The Pro model retails for $3,999 because of its Nikon eyepiece, while the regular Odyssey model sells for $2,499. The company sells more advanced models, but the Odyssey and Odyssey Pro are the units best suited to newcomers and longtime enthusiasts.</p><h5 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h5><p><strong>Weight</strong> </p><p> 8.8lbs </p><p><strong>Field of view</strong> </p><p> 33.6 x 45arcmin </p><p><strong>Focal length</strong> </p><p> 320mm </p><p><strong>Storage</strong> </p><p> 64GB </p><p><strong>Battery life</strong> </p><p> 5 hours </p><h2 id="A-Premium-Telescope-Experience"><a href="#A-Premium-Telescope-Experience" class="headerlink" title="A Premium Telescope Experience"></a>A Premium Telescope Experience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/unistellar-odyssey-pro-outsiode-pointed-up.JPG"                      alt="Unistellar Odyssey Pro outsiode pointed up"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> As a technology enthusiast, I highly appreciate the simple, connected nature of the Odyssey line of telescopes. There’s an eyepiece on the Pro model, but there are almost no manual controls. It’s meant to all be automatic, even to manual coordinates that can be added in the app.</p><p> The mobile app is a critical piece of the puzzle which will move, orientate, and focus the telescope. Beyond the wireless connectivity that simplified the use, I appreciated the sleek body. Despite handling a $4,000 product, I was never really worried about accidentally grabbing a sensitive piece or fragile knob. I even consider the single power button and limited ports a net win for ease of use. I never felt overwhelmed or limited.</p><p> Yes, the price is high, but that’s more of an impedance to impulse buying, rather than bad value or anything else.</p><p> As a tangent, high-quality computers like a MacBook Pro are pricey, but people passionate about breaking into the music or YouTube industries purchase that kind of tool all the time. The Odyssey Pro is an investment but should be a consideration for dedicated enthusiasts—amateurs welcome. However, since the Odyssey model is exactly the same as the Pro model, minus the eyepiece viewing, I would recommend opting for that one, unless you need the eyepiece for a specific reason.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photos-of-the-Sky"><a href="#Photos-of-the-Sky" class="headerlink" title="Photos of the Sky"></a>Photos of the Sky</h2><p>Close </p><p> No matter the cost or the features, ultimately, a product’s worth comes down to its results. Simply put, I was thrilled with the reaches of the outer space that the Odyssey Pro was able to pull down into my yard.</p><p> Without much effort, I was able to see multiple galaxies, stars, and other heavenly objects.</p><p> Just like real estate, it’s all about location, location, location with a telescope. That’s one big caveat for anyone living in a place with limited sky visibility. The earth rotates and objects in the sky have times of better and worse observance, but if your location has a small sightline to the sky, nothing can really change that. You’ll need to pack up the Odyssey Pro and head out to a better vantage point every time you want to use it.</p><p> Jupiter and a couple of other planets were blocked by neighbors’ houses during my time with the telescope, for example, so I would have needed to head to a local park. I can only imagine the kinds of imagery people living in a rural area could get.</p><p> Here are some unedited photos I was able to get from my suburban vantage point.</p><p>Close </p><p> In the app, you can choose to have photos labeled to remember what you’re looking at in the future—you can also snap labeled and unlabeled photos simultaneously. Here are some examples of the same pictures above, labeled.</p><p>Close </p><h2 id="A-Good-but-Not-Amazing-App"><a href="#A-Good-but-Not-Amazing-App" class="headerlink" title="A Good, but Not Amazing App"></a>A Good, but Not Amazing App</h2><p> Even though the Pro model includes an eyepiece, the whole experience of using an Odyssey telescope relies on its mobile app, available for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/unistellar/id1435141427?l=fr-CA&_ga=2.51406889.1487549971.1713455674-650011739.1711638048&_gac=1.21017289.1713455674.Cj0KCQjwiYOxBhC5ARIsAIvdH51zt4aeq0X0svsM6cEevnRvGVzcPKiXAINzFnDaMGjvFZunRsYJgRgaAmImEALw_wcB" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002701/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unistellar.evscope.android&hl=fr&gl=US&_ga=2.180625831.1487549971.1713455674-650011739.1711638048&_gac=1.117455611.1713455674.Cj0KCQjwiYOxBhC5ARIsAIvdH51zt4aeq0X0svsM6cEevnRvGVzcPKiXAINzFnDaMGjvFZunRsYJgRgaAmImEALw_wcB" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s the part you interact with frequently. Once the telescope is firmly planted outside, it’s all about the software.</p><p> I was disappointed by the app a few times, but it was never serious enough to question the product’s value. Mostly, I wished certain aspects of the app were more discoverable and easier to get to.</p><p> In a few instances, I craved more control from the onscreen buttons. There didn’t seem to be a way to zoom out from an object that was being observed. Although I got a perfectly framed image of the moon partially covering the sun during the eclipse, I would have liked to zoom out farther to see more of the sky in the frame.</p><p> The area for editing the picture, by manually adjusting the brightness controls, could be finicky with me, and in my skyline views, didn’t do much. These things didn’t impede using the telescope or getting a great automatic view, but continually poking and swiping on the touchscreen to uncover the manipulation method was confusing.</p><p> Of course, the best feature of the app is the catalog of objects that the telescope can be automatically navigated to. It can be overwhelming at first, with potentially thousands of items to spy on. This is where enthusiasm for space discovery is a necessity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Travel-May-be-a-Chore"><a href="#Travel-May-be-a-Chore" class="headerlink" title="Travel May be a Chore"></a>Travel May be a Chore</h2><p>Close </p><p> As easy as the Odyssey Pro is to use at your house, there’s a big temptation to want to take it out on camping trips or other excursions. Keep in mind though that the telescope itself weighs 8.8 pounds and the tripod weighs another 5.5 pounds for a total somewhere in the 14-pound range. That’s not heavy per se, but it’s also not lightweight. I really wish the Odyssey Pro came with a case, even just for storage, but it doesn’t. The backpack that Unistellar sells is in the $400 range too.</p><p> All that is to say, the telescope may not be the easiest to travel with for one reason or another. Keep in mind the telescope also requires power. Its built-in battery has an advertised 5-hour battery life. That rang true in my tests. I left the telescope on for about 60 minutes during the solar eclipse, having it track it and keep it in frame the entire time which resulted in about 20% battery drain. It started at 100% and when I stopped staring at the sun, through the device, it was around 80% full.</p><p> The telescope comes with an AC power adapter with a USB-C plug on the other end, but you can use other cables or even a power bank to recharge it if you’re away from the house.</p><p> You won’t be getting a lighter tripod either since the one it uses is specially designed to house the Odyssey line of telescopes. (It’s a nice, sturdy tripod though.)</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Unistellar-Odyssey-Pro"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Unistellar-Odyssey-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Unistellar Odyssey Pro?"></a>Should You Buy the Unistellar Odyssey Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/eyepiece-on-the-unistellar-odyssey-pro.JPG"                      alt="Eyepiece on the Unistellar Odyssey Pro"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://shop.unistellar.com/products/odyssey-pro" >Unistellar Odyssey Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is unquestionably a great device for reaching into the heavens. It uncovered a completely new perspective for me on the twinkling lights I often take for granted. I especially enjoyed its ability to be a shared experience as multiple people peeked over my shoulder at its sights shown on my phone’s screen.</p><p> If that’s the kind of space experience you’re seeking, one that fuels discovery, then I wholeheartedly recommend the Odyssey Pro. (The regular Odyssey may make more sense for most people though.) You don’t need to be a space expert yet, but if you’re interested in becoming one, this telescope may be a way to get there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cleanshot-2024-04-12-at-13-18-45-2x.png"                      alt="Unistellar Odyssey Pro telescope"                > </p><h5 id="Unistellar-Odyssey-Pro-1"><a href="#Unistellar-Odyssey-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Unistellar Odyssey Pro"></a>Unistellar Odyssey Pro</h5><p>7&#x2F; 10 </p><p>Perfect for those seeking versatility in observing planets and deep-sky objects with a single, portable telescope.

Whether you’re a casual gamer or a dedicated player seeking some hearty challenges, the team at How-To Geek has put together a list of our favorite games to play locally.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130886/7443" target="_top" id="2130886">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130886" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130886/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Puyo-Puyo-Tetris-2"><a href="#1-Puyo-Puyo-Tetris-2" class="headerlink" title="1 Puyo Puyo Tetris 2"></a>1 <em>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</em></h2><p> An all-time favorite of mine, <em>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</em> is the adorably fun mashup of Sega’s <em>Puyo Puyo</em> puzzler series and the all-time classic <em>Tetris.</em> Players can face off against up to three friends to outlast the rest in “swap battles” which switch between both games on the fly mid-match, or simply play each game separately.</p><p> While <em>Tetris</em> tasks players with stacking various shaped blocks to create “lines” that earn points, <em>Puyo Puyo</em> is a gravity-based match-four puzzle game. The game is available for nearly every platform under the sun and even has a free demo that effectively lets you play the main game mode infinitely at no cost, so the barrier for entry is fairly minimal.</p><h2 id="2-Duck-Game"><a href="#2-Duck-Game" class="headerlink" title="2 Duck Game"></a>2 <em>Duck Game</em></h2><p> A fittingly funny product of Adult Swim Games, <em>Duck Game</em> puts you and your friends in control of some cartoon ducks in various 2D arenas with a multitude of weapons and tasks you with just one thing: survive. The last player standing earns a point and the first to reach a set number of points wins the game.</p><p> On top of weapons like machine guns, rocket launchers, and even melee options, there is a plethora of power-ups and modifiers you can turn on or off to enhance the game even more. <em>Duck Game</em> is available on the PlayStation 4&#x2F;5, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Rocket-League"><a href="#3-Rocket-League" class="headerlink" title="3 Rocket League"></a>3 <em>Rocket League</em></h2><p> Affectionately called “soccer with cars” by many, <em>Rocket League</em> is, well, pretty much exactly that. The game pits players against each other in rocket-powered cars to score goals. Players can face off against each other in split-screen matches, or team up against others online.</p><p> Featuring robust customization options for your in-game vehicles and a slew of game modes and modifiers, there is no shortage of things to unlock and work towards. The game went free to play a few years back and is available on all current platforms making it a fun, free way to spend an afternoon with some friends.</p><h2 id="4-Brawlhalla"><a href="#4-Brawlhalla" class="headerlink" title="4 Brawlhalla"></a>4 <em>Brawlhalla</em></h2><p> Despite its reputation as a free alternative to <em>Super Smash Bros.,</em> <em>Brawlhalla</em> has a lot of its own unique charms compared to Nintendo’s flagship fighter. It takes on the same 2D level design and similar mechanics where damage builds over time but retains its own identity with slower-paced gameplay and mostly original characters.</p><p> While the game is free to play, it does have a limited roster of free characters that cycle out regularly, with the rest available for permanent unlock via <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-list-7-cost-free-video-tags-extractors-on-youtube/" >microtransactions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With franchises like the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> making their way into the roster, it may be worth a punt if you’re a fan of fighting games.</p><h2 id="5-Portal-2"><a href="#5-Portal-2" class="headerlink" title="5 Portal 2"></a>5 <em>Portal 2</em></h2><p> One of the most iconic games of all time and certainly one of the best puzzle-platformers out there, <em>Portal 2</em> tasks players with navigating a series of test chambers using their portal gun that allows them to move from one point to another instantaneously. While the single-player campaign is already one of the greatest of all time, the game also features a robust two-player co-op campaign where players can solve increasingly difficult rooms together.</p><p> Players control a pair of charming little robots as they work their way through the campaign’s numerous stages, working together to overcome each challenge in uniquely inventive ways. The game is available on the PlayStation 4&#x2F;5, Xbox One and Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC and Mac.</p><h2 id="6-Overcooked"><a href="#6-Overcooked" class="headerlink" title="6 Overcooked!"></a>6 <em>Overcooked!</em></h2><p> A fun twist on the restaurant sim genre, <em>Overcooked!</em> is a duology of fast-paced co-op cooking games where players must manage resources and work together to fill orders on time. The levels get increasingly more chaotic as the game progresses and players will have to work together to find the most efficient ways to split up their tasks and keep the food moving.</p><p> It doesn’t matter which game you choose to pick up, both offer a similar amount of content, though the sequel also offers online multiplayer for those who might want it. Available on the PS4&#x2F;5, Xbox One and Series X&#x2F;S, PC, and Nintendo Switch, <em>Overcooked!</em> serves up fast-paced fun for everyone.</p><h2 id="7-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition"><a href="#7-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition" class="headerlink" title="7 Minecraft: Bedrock Edition"></a>7 <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em></h2><p> One of the less obvious features of the Bedrock version of <em>Minecraft</em> is that it is the only one to support local multiplayer via split-screen on console versions. Up to four players can build, craft, and survive together in procedurally generated worlds or build the structures of their dreams in creative mode all from the same room.</p><p> The game also supports cross-platform online multiplayer across the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch versions of the game, and online players can join your split-screen sessions seamlessly. <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> is available on the PlayStation 4&#x2F;5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S and Nintendo Switch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997690/19272" target="_top" id="1997690">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997690" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997690/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Super-Mario-Party"><a href="#8-Super-Mario-Party" class="headerlink" title="8 Super Mario Party"></a>8 <em>Super Mario Party</em></h2><p> The long-running <em>Super Mario Party</em> franchise is Nintendo’s flagship board game simulator featuring fan-favorite characters from the Mario universe. The latest entry, <em>Super Mario Party</em> for the Nintendo Switch, is a more streamlined take on the series that pits players against each other in turn-based competitions mixed in with fun, short-form minigames.</p><p> While the newest entry lacks the same amount of content as older titles, it does bring backstages and mini-games from previous titles and offers hours of fun between you and your friends. Choose between your favorite Mario characters and battle it out to get the most stars by the end of the last turn to take home the victory.</p><h2 id="9-Baldur’s-Gate-3"><a href="#9-Baldur’s-Gate-3" class="headerlink" title="9 Baldur’s Gate 3"></a>9 <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></h2><p> 2023’s Game of the Year winner, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> already offers hundreds of hours of RPG content, but with another player, the possibilities are even broader. Players can party up with a friend and make their own characters to venture through the game’s open world together.</p><p> Considering how large and robust the game already is, playing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> with a friend could add a whole new layer of strategy and decision-making as you work together to beat bosses and make story decisions. The game is available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC; the Series S version does not feature split-screen co-op, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043593/7443" target="_top" id="2043593">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043593" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043593/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Call-of-Duty"><a href="#10-Call-of-Duty" class="headerlink" title="10 Call of Duty"></a>10 <em>Call of Duty</em></h2><p> Most of the <em>Call of Duty</em> titles feature split-screen gameplay across most game modes, except Warzone in <em>Modern Warfare III.</em> Whether you’re looking for co-op action with the zombies mode or you want to battle it out in several competitive modes, you and some friends can do worse than the flagship shooter franchise on consoles.</p><p> You can even team up with friends locally for multiplayer matches, letting you experience most of the content in the same room with almost no limits. Of course, not every <em>Call of Duty</em> game supports this, so make sure whichever you choose supports the game modes you want to play before you buy. The games are available pretty much everywhere including PlayStation 4&#x2F;5, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, and PC.</p><hr><p> If you’re looking for some fun, same-room couch gameplay with some friends and you want to try out some of these games, consider <a class="link"   href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/leading-platforms-for-virtual-team-meetings-and-group-calls/" >checking them out from your local library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they offer them.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Develop-a-Research-Timeline"><a href="#Develop-a-Research-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Develop a Research Timeline"></a>Develop a Research Timeline</h2><p> If you love playing games like I do, you want to know there are plenty of ways to do so.

It has all the charm you’d expect from a Nintendo console. It takes seconds to start up, its menu system is easy to figure out, and its game catalog is fantastic.</p><p> It’s starting to show its age with slower performance on some games but it’s worth the longer loading times.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>OLED screen looks fantastic</li><li>Extensive catalog of exclusive games</li><li>Can connect it to TV</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hardware is starting to show its age</li><li>No performance updates beyond the display</li></ul><p> Nothing about the Nintendo Switch OLED is clunky. The only ads you’ll see are for Nintendo services, so it’s very family-friendly. Game options include all your childhood favorites, including plenty of new versions of Mario, like Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Wonder, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the Legend of Zelda franchise.</p><p> There’s some comfort here, but the Nintendo Switch OLED still has room for more adult games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-nintendo-switch-controller-5218934" >leave games in sleep mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you can quickly resume where you left off, which is useful if you need to pause while traveling.</p><p> Back home, you can plug the console into your TV via the included dock to gather around as a family to play multiplayer games or enjoy a single-player session on a bigger screen. This feels less essential solo than with previous Switches, as the OLED screen looks great, but it’s nice to have the option.</p><p> Online play requires<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a paid service that offers emulated versions of old favorites from past consoles.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Wired, T3, Tom’s Guide, Digital Trends, and CNET recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> 90% of buyers on Amazon have rated the Nintendo Switch OLED five stars, with the console having an average score of 4.8 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >Valve Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0UYqsaz73PWhH6z5ksLDbIhSU-w=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SteamDeckOLED2-3ea64c8ac24943b5b4eb2e57f9ffe6f7.jpg" >Steam Deck OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >$450 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/2237665775" >$459 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" >$399 at Steampowered.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Steam Deck makes PC gaming truly portable and much simpler than ever before. It’s all within a sleek and easy to hold shell with a great screen whether you go LED or OLED. As with the Switch, you can always dock it, and even install Windows if you want a full portable PC.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC. Designed like a Nintendo Switch, it provides easy access to your Steam library thanks to running SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p> While you might be thinking, a gaming laptop does all that, the Steam Deck is far more portable than any gaming laptop.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Huge range of games via Steam</li><li>More accessible PC gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Battery life can be poor</li><li>Customization can get very complicated</li></ul><p> Because the Steam Deck is built like a Nintendo Switch, it feels very portable. Its either 7-inch LCD or 7.4-inch OLED screen ensures you can see plenty of what’s going on without the bulk of a 14- —to 17-inch laptop screen.</p><p> Due to its size, it won’t play games at the highest detail level but it still looks good and aligns well with the screen size involved. You can always dock it with your TV, like the Nintendo Switch, if you prefer.</p><p> Regular PC gamers like me will already have extensive Steam libraries to explore, and there are often sales on the Steam store, meaning the Steam Deck can provide good value over time.</p><p> Not every game on the store is compatible with the Steam Deck, but the number is growing rapidly.</p><p> Technically minded people can also spend time customizing the device, either installing Windows to extend their options or other game launchers like Battle.net or the Epic Games Store Launcher. It’s fun to tinker with.</p><p> Battery life could be better, but the Steam Deck truly is a PC in your hands, so that’s to be expected. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, and I’ve enjoyed catching up with my Steam library in a couch-friendly format.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Verge, Forbes, IGN, PCGamer, and Wired have all recommended the Steam Deck with the Steam Deck OLED considered a particular highlight.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Steam Deck has sold over 3 million units on the Steam website.

It feels like holding a Game Boy, and it’s very lightweight.</p><p> True to its name, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket fits in your pocket. The controls take a brief time to get used to, as they’re quite close together and there are a handful of buttons on the back panel, but they’re reasonably well placed.</p><p> The Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket is far more than just whichever edition you buy, as it also supports Evercade cartridges. There are over 45 cartridges available, providing access to over 500 retro games at relatively low prices.</p><p> Titles include Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, Flashback, and Pac-Man.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Sometimes, we take a look at our cable internet bill and gasp—paying that extra $10 a month to rent a modem really adds up. That’s why devices like the Netgear C3700 are so important. At under $100, this modem can probably pay for itself in under a year while still providing the speeds we expect from our service (at least over a wired connection).</p><p> We got our hands on the Netgear C3700 for testing and put it through the wringer to see whether or not it’s worth your cash, and what kind of performance you can expect.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-and-inconspicuous"><a href="#Design-Small-and-inconspicuous" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small and inconspicuous"></a>Design: Small and inconspicuous</h2><p> With a device that packs<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cable-modem-router-combos-to-buy-4082541" >both a cable modem and a wireless router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you might expect the Netgear C3700 to be a bulky device, but that’s not the case. It’s actually quite small, measuring just 7.6 inches high and weighing a scant 0.77 pounds. This, combined with the low-key black finish and lack of external antennas means that it won’t stick out, no matter where you put it.</p><p> This definitely works in the Netgear C3700’s favor.

We just unplugged our existing cable modem, plugged all the cables into this new one, and waited for the lights to turn on. Then all we had to do was phone our ISP to activate it.</p><p> To make things even easier, Netgear has included self-activation instructions for a number of major carriers so you can skip the phone bit. Through our Xfinity 250Mbps service, we simply went to the URL, printed on the instructions, signed in, and we were online.</p><p> Once everything is set up, you can go through the online management portal to change wireless settings. This is an optional step since the wireless network works right out of the box using the information printed on the side of the modem.</p><p> We weren’t impressed with the wireless performance, but the wired performance surprised us.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Everything-a-small-home-needs"><a href="#Connectivity-Everything-a-small-home-needs" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Everything a small home needs"></a>Connectivity: Everything a small home needs</h2><p> The Netgear C3700 is a modem-router combo, which means, hypothetically, it’s the only networking device many people will need. On top of the two Gigabit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, you’re also getting dual antennas, which makes this a dual-band device (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz). It’s not the fastest wireless connection in the world, though—the Netgear C3700 is rated for N600 speeds, something we haven’t seen in a few years.</p><p> It is an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 modem, meaning it’s capable of handling internet speeds up to 340 Mbps. But that N600 wireless speed means that devices on Wi-Fi won’t be that fast. If you have a really fast internet connection like we do, it might be best to use an external wireless router.</p><p> There is also a USB 2.0 port around the back where you can plug in a hard drive or a printer for network access.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Great-when-wired-but-wireless-speeds-lag"><a href="#Network-Performance-Great-when-wired-but-wireless-speeds-lag" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Great when wired, but wireless speeds lag"></a>Network Performance: Great when wired, but wireless speeds lag</h2><p> We didn’t exactly have high hopes for the C3700 and its N600 wireless rating. At its peak during testing, we reached wireless speeds of 130Mbps, but that didn’t last—with multiple devices connected and in use, we were seeing speeds as low as 40Mbps just a few feet away from the router.</p><p> We weren’t impressed with the wireless performance, but the wired performance surprised us. Even after connecting 13 devices to our network, we were able to get our advertised 250 Mbps speeds through a wired connection, and sometimes even higher.</p><p> Thankfully, this means that an attached router would be able to keep up, which is what we’d recommend. The wireless performance isn’t great and you’re going to have a much better experience with a separate router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lPF7EXzNUljkXFySwthTmhwRbiY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-5-6-1c4a748dd9b644c39d8bd8c47180c74f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear C3700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Bill Thomas</p><h2 id="Software-No-frills"><a href="#Software-No-frills" class="headerlink" title="Software: No frills"></a>Software: No frills</h2><p> We prefer a network backend that’s straight to the point, and that’s exactly what we got with the Netgear C3700.</p><p> The management portal is incredibly simple. Upon logging in, there are six tiles that you can click on to change settings like your wireless password, attached devices, and anything connected to the USB port. These tiles will also show you the status of your network at a glance: how many devices are attached, whether your cable connection is working, and even your network password.</p><p> We were able to click over into the “advanced” tab to gain access to more robust controls, but this shouldn’t be necessary for most users. Power users will probably appreciate the fine controls.</p><p> You can also download the Netgear Genie app on your phone, which allows you to manage your network from a more attractive interface. Much of the same functionality is here, but it might be a more approachable interface for those who don’t really know where to start with their router settings.</p><h2 id="Price-It-pays-for-itself"><a href="#Price-It-pays-for-itself" class="headerlink" title="Price: It pays for itself"></a>Price: It pays for itself</h2><p> The Netgear C3700 retails for $109.99, but you should be able to find it for less (as of the time of this writing, it’s on sale for about $95). At this price, the modem has a head start on paying for itself.</p><p> For an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem with a lightweight router built in, this price is about par for the course. If you can find the Netgear C3700 for under $100, then it might be worth buying for the cable modem performance and pairing it with a solid wireless router.</p><h2 id="Netgear-C3700-vs-Arris-Surfboard-SBG6700-AC"><a href="#Netgear-C3700-vs-Arris-Surfboard-SBG6700-AC" class="headerlink" title="Netgear C3700 vs. Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC"></a>Netgear C3700 vs. Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC</h2><p> The Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC has the same 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable rating but ups the wireless support to AC1600 speeds. This still isn’t top-of-the-line wireless speed—and it is a bit more expensive at $119 MSRP—but that extra cash is worth the improved network performance. However, the Arris model does not have a USB 2.0 port for network-attached storage or printers.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A solid modem, but the poor wireless performance undermines its appeal as a combo device.</strong><br> The cable modem’s performance is great, but the wireless performance is just not there. If all you want is the cheapest possible modem with built-in dual-band Wi-Fi, then the Netgear C3700 checks those boxes. But we think you’re better off spending more for better performance or just buying two standalone devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-mg7700-review-4589346" >Motorola MG7700 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-nighthawk-c7000-review-4686068" >Netgear Nighthawk C7000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C3700 Cable Modem Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>Price  $109.99</li><li>Release Date  February 2014</li><li>Weight  0.77 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 4.45 x 1.63 in.</li><li>UPC  606449099089</li><li>Speed  N600</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  No</li><li>MU-MIMO  No</li><li>Number of Antennas  2</li><li>Number of Bands  2</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  2</li><li>Chipset  Broadcom BCM3383G</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/5-solutions-for-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>5 Solutions For Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-amazfit-gts-a-fusion-of-fashion-and-physical-activity-mixed-successes/"><u>Analyzing the Amazfit GTS: A Fusion of Fashion and Physical Activity, Mixed Successes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/asus-keyboard-lights-dimming/"><u>Asus Keyboard Lights Dimming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/end-audio-blackout-vocalize-tweet-videos/"><u>End Audio Blackout Vocalize Tweet Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-lenovo-thinkphone-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Lenovo ThinkPhone?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you have a growing family or a growing list of devices competing for bandwidth in your home, you’ve probably experienced jockeying for a signal here or there. That’s where a capable tri-band router like the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router comes in handy. This router boasts high-speed Wi-Fi of up to 3.2Gbps and three different Wi-Fi bands that work simultaneously to deliver the connectivity all your family members and devices require.</p><p> We used this tri-band router and observed various aspects starting with the setup process, software ease of use, and performance power when performing typical streaming and browsing activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q6eQHVPL_nzfI20_HhRY5seg85c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-3-3baf530c5df54c9c903579053d19c25c.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-little-flashy"><a href="#Design-A-little-flashy" class="headerlink" title="Design: A little flashy"></a><strong>Design: A little flashy</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 router is aptly named for its six antennas that are fixed to both sides of the face of the device. While you can easily fold these antennas flat, for easy moving to and from one spot to another, you’ll need to place them upright in order to maximize the signal strength.</p><p> Aside from the unique antenna design, all the indicator lights are also presented in a sort of stylish way right down the middle of the router. All the lights flash white and the Wi-Fi on&#x2F;off and WPS buttons are set off on their own at the bottom with triangular buttons. The main body of the router is box-like in shape and skews larger with dimensions of 11.63 x 8.92 x 2.14 inches (HWD). Some shoppers may like the aeronautic design of the router, inspired by the Nighthawk stealth fighter plane, which also looks somewhat futuristic. If you’re looking for a router that’s unassuming, you won’t find that here.</p><p> All the ports are easy to locate at the back of the device. These include four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one WAN port, and one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and one USB 2.0 port. You’ll also find the power button and DC power input in the same row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GsN851fjmzxtWs6ShQfaWQtEPok=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-2-b6366698f8d14745a5027973d8657745.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road</strong></h2><p> Unboxing the Nighthawk X6 R8000, we were reminded several times to download the companion Nighthawk<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete the setup process. There is a sticker on top of the router with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the app can use to detect the router and launches a quick setup process, but we couldn’t get this code to register. Instead, we went to the App Store and manually downloaded the mobile app.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices.</p><p> The first thing we had to do when we launched the Nighthawk app was to create a Netgear account. Then we chose the “New Setup” option and were directed to reboot our modem and then attach the provided Ethernet cable into the router and our modem. Almost instantly we were able to connect to the default network using the credentials the manufacturer provided. We returned to the app to set up another line of defense to the router admin login credentials with security questions and customize our system network and password.</p><p> After these changes, we had to reconnect to the network which went off without a hitch. We further chose to apply the firmware update that was recommended. That took several minutes and also required rebooting the router. At this point, we noticed that the second 5GHz connection was lost. After several attempts to make things right by resetting the router and the modem and router, the only step that resolved it was a factory reset. We suspect this could have been an issue with the firmware update, but once all of that was finally resolved we were able to connect to our 150Mbps Xfinity service on all three bands.</p><p> Overall, minus the hitch that tacked on an additional 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, we found the guided setup to be straightforward, quick, and easy to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHfwPJF-cpnSAITo_i4moZ2Jnw0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-4-1d3586d798cf44a9b219c9fd885069b3.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology"><a href="#Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology"></a><strong>Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology</strong></h2><p> This is an 802.11ac tri-band router, meaning it supports three frequencies: one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz channels on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/802-11ac-in-wireless-networking-818284" >802.11ac wireless standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The advantage here is that unlike older single- or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that operate on older Wi-Fi standards or even newer dual-band options functioning on the most current Wi-Fi 5 standard, there’s additional support for more devices and less competition over bandwidth.</p><p> That’s supported by beamforming technology, which is a feature all 802.11ac routers support. This technology sends targeted Wi-Fi signals to your devices rather than sending them in every direction. Ultimately, this means a stronger direct signal to your laptop, TV, or other devices, and potentially more consistent and stronger connections.</p><p> Since this router is classified as an AC3200 device, that means it has the potential to deliver up to 600Mbps (megabit per second) on the 2.4GHz spectrum and up to 1300Mbps on the 5GHz channels. This Wi-Fi speed rating doesn’t guarantee you’ll see these exact results in your home. It’s merely a number that describes the absolute potential performance power. In reality, the speeds you see will depend on the type of internet service plan you have and other environmental and network conditions that impact wireless performance.</p><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 also comes with Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) technology, which is another tool for managing bandwidth by allocating signals in specific directions and based on your priorities. Netgear says that users who like to game and stream video (and have combined download and upload speeds of less than 300Mbps) could garner enhanced performance by enabling this feature, which you can do from the web interface—but not the app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948905/19272" target="_top" id="1948905">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948905" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948905/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming</strong></h2><p> Using the Nighthawk app’s built-in speed test feature, which uses the Ookla SpeedTest technology, the best download speed registered at 95Mbps right after we set up the router. More typically, the output was around 88-95Mbps at varying points in the day.</p><p> We could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands.</p><p> We never experienced a completely dropped connection, but at times the 2.4GHz channel performed sluggishly with simple operations like checking email or online browsing. We connected TVs where we stream HD and 4K content and use a gaming console to the 5GHz networks and used the 2.4GHz channel for laptops, mobile devices, and a tablet. Distributing those devices across the other two bands seemed to ease some congestion, and we could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands. We also noticed a mild improvement in image clarity and loading speed of streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.</p><p> Though we were unable to test the full range of this router, we had no issues in our 1,100-square-foot space. The manufacturer does say that this device can serve very large homes and there are six antennas that help boost this coverage, but the actual range—just like speed—will depend on factors like the thickness of your walls, router placement, and interference from other signals and devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qDgf4s6CZg8XEea_CVo6DMwg5lg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-5-733eda7f890a4105b5bc94ddf8169c81.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly and intuitive"></a><strong>Software: User-friendly and intuitive</strong></h2><p> Everything is laid out quite cleanly in the Nighthawk app in terms of guided setup and accessing the information most users will probably be interested in—like speed information, devices connected, Wi-Fi settings, and parental controls using the Circle with Disney app to monitor everyone’s screen time and activity. The app also comes with a 30-day trial of Netgear Armor security, which does the work of detecting threats from malware, bots, and any other network vulnerabilities.</p><p> The mobile app certainly skews more toward the general user with its uncomplicated layout, but that also means less control over more technical specifications which requires using the web interface. This information isn’t necessarily hidden, but it’s only laid out in the user manual which is accessible from the Netgear site.</p><p> This router is equally friendly to the general user as well as the more tech-savvy customer.</p><p> While the Nighthawk X6 does come with built-in firewall protection, you can elevate security settings and personalize the router setup from the router’s web interface. From the web GUI’s advanced settings area, you can control access or block certain websites, set up security email notifications, establish VPN service, create a personal FTP server, or use<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-dynamic-dns-816294" >Dynamic DNS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Other features of interest through the web GUI include setting up a USB device to perform Time Machine backups for Mac laptops and using the router’s media server capabilities to play music from the iTunes server.</p><p> In this respect, the Nighthawk X6 R8000 is equally friendly to the general user who doesn’t want to delve into the technical deep end as well as the more tech-savvy customer who does.</p><h2 id="Price-A-bit-steep"><a href="#Price-A-bit-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bit steep"></a><strong>Price: A bit steep</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 has a list price of $270, which certainly places it in the high-end tier of wireless routers. And while it’s not the most expensive tri-band router on the market, your decision to make this investment could come down to factors like how large your home is, how many devices you’re working with, and how fast your internet service plan is. The tri-band Wi-Fi technology is impressive, and there are many attractive features: an intuitive and low-effort app, built-in security with Netgear Armor, as well as a detailed level of control over managing how everyone in the family spends their screen time, but there are equally capable as less expensive options on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200</strong></h2><p> One of the strengths of the Nighthawk X6 R800 is how fast and simple it is to set up for even those who are tech-shy. But if you’re willing or interested in diving in deeper technically, paying less, and still obtaining impressive Wi-Fi performance, the Asus RT-AC3200 retails for $200 and overlaps with the Nighthawk X6 in a number of ways. Both feature three bands, six antennas, QoS and beamforming technologies, VPN and Time Machine support, and peace of mind with respective built-in security platforms.</p><p> The Asus router does require a little more technical know-how for managing the router via the app and web interface. Another factor that may influence whether you think this trade-off is worth it is your interest in integrating your router into a smart-home configuration. The Nighthawk X6 R8000, like many other<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-netgear-routers-4159862" >Netgear routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does allow that with Amazon Alexa compatibility whereas the Asus RT-AC3200 does not.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An investment that could be worth it for the family with a smart home.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices. If you’re interested in spending less time with configuration and more time benefiting from the assurance that your network is protected, the Nighthawk X6 can fulfill those wants. You can also easily bring this device into the fold of your smart-home setup and keep a close eye on the online safety and activity of everyone in the family.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router (R8000)</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>MPN  R8000</li><li>Price  $269.99</li><li>Weight  2.43 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.63 x 8 x 2.14 in.</li><li>Compatibility  Amazon Echo&#x2F;Alexa</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antenna  6</li><li>Number of Bands  3</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  7</li><li>Chipset  BCM4709AO</li><li>Range  Very large homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-guide-to-the-best-money-estimation-apps-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Guide to the Best Money Estimation Apps on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unleash-your-potential-with-these-top-12-pc-clickers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unleash Your Potential with These Top 12 PC Clickers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-elite-steadicam-models-suitable-for-drones-in-cinema-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elite Steadicam Models Suitable for Drones in Cinema for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/decision-guide-choosing-between-ipad-pro-or-macbook-pro-for-your-needs/"><u>Decision Guide: Choosing Between iPad Pro or MacBook Pro for Your Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-the-superiority-of-nixplay-seed-photo-frame/"><u>Discover the Superiority of Nixplay Seed Photo Frame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-what-sets-the-new-sony-playstation-5-apart-from-older-models/"><u>Discover What Sets the New Sony PlayStation 5 Apart From Older Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/effortless-nourishment-with-arfs-autofeeder-the-smart-solution-for-your-furry-friend/"><u>Effortless Nourishment with Arf's AutoFeeder - The Smart Solution for Your Furry Friend</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/elevate-console-battles-on-the-asus-vg245h-a-top-tier-monitor-engineered-for-gamers/"><u>Elevate Console Battles on the Asus VG245H: A Top-Tier Monitor Engineered for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/empire-building-in-offworld-trading-game-a-comprehensive-review-of-strategies-and-success-stories/"><u>Empire Building in Offworld Trading Game: A Comprehensive Review of Strategies and Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/enhancing-your-wireless-network-with-netgear-nighthawk-x4-mesh-extender-an-in-depth-review/"><u>Enhancing Your Wireless Network with Netgear Nighthawk X4 Mesh Extender - An In-Depth Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-latest-superior-smartphone-from-apple-iphone-12-unboxed/"><u>Evaluating the Latest Superior Smartphone From Apple - iPhone 12 Unboxed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/four-effective-methods-to-save-audioboom-episodes-as-downloads/"><u>Four Effective Methods to Save Audioboom Episodes as Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-average-to-amazing-8-tactics-for-exciting-unboxing-reels/"><u>In 2024, From Average to Amazing 8 Tactics for Exciting Unboxing Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/solved-move-from-oppo-a56s-5g-to-ios-not-working-problems-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>Solved Move from Oppo A56s 5G to iOS not Working Problems | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/three-solutions-to-hard-reset-xiaomi-redmi-12-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Three Solutions to Hard Reset Xiaomi Redmi 12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/top-2024-fb-ad-trends-dont-miss-out/"><u>Top 2024 FB Ad Trends Don't Miss Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/why-is-new-world-constantly-crashing-on-my-computer-expert-advice-and-solutions/"><u>Why Is 'New World' Constantly Crashing on My Computer?

We decided to test it for a few hours a day over the course of a week to see how it worked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KYfJPJ0jHZhmy15IUeGxDL8kmRw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-2-547d9823c4ac47cbb5a360040866172a.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047366/19272" target="_top" id="2047366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016143/19272" target="_top" id="2016143">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016143" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016143/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Simply-modern"><a href="#Design-Simply-modern" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simply modern"></a><strong>Design: Simply modern</strong></h2><p> At 26.2 inches by 29 inches (LW), the Topo is a fairly wide mat, giving the user lots of berth to shift around. It comes with two power wedges in the back with calf-stretching inclines in the front that end up going 2.7 inches high, though the bottom platform of the mat is much thinner. It also comes with a massage mound in the center of the mat. For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0MLp0JKyXodrqDxUdun30XlUicQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-3-5e85cbed72974e018684fe954f0ddf1b-75abe4f41eba41c3b202cdf74fbf3caa.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid"><a href="#Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Flawed, but still solid"></a><strong>Performance: Flawed, but still solid</strong></h2><p> As we previously stated, one of the features of this mat is the massage mound in the center. When we first stepped onto the mat, we really disliked how we couldn’t shift without bumping the massage mound. It’s a great feature if you want to change your ankle stances or relieve your foot pain. However, if you’re standing on the mat for extended hours at a time, your feet are stuck off to the sides and you really can’t shift around as time progresses.</p><p> For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center, we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p> That said, other features of the mat are spectacular. The front wedges are designed to stretch your calves. When we used them throughout the day, they really helped to relieve the tightness from extended standing periods. Though we did feel they were a steeper incline than other mats we’ve recently tested.</p><p> Another great feature is the rear power wedges. While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by. It’s steeper than other models we tested. The steeper incline was better in many ways because it gave us a more intense hamstring stretch. It was a great way to get the blood circulating.</p><p> While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove in which you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by.</p><p> We also liked how the mat slides around on various surfaces, but it’s not too slippery. We hauled it around to various offices with tile and carpet. Each time we set it down, we could push it under the desk with ease if we needed to sit for extended lengths of time and pull it out just as easily when we wanted to stand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat"><a href="#Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat" class="headerlink" title="Price: Pretty steep for a mat"></a><strong>Price: Pretty steep for a mat</strong></h2><p> At around $100 on Amazon, the Topo is in the higher price range for a standing desk mat. We could find models that don’t have the massage mound in the center, however, the steep power wedges in the back make it a reasonable investment for anyone who really wants to stretch out their legs.</p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice.</p><h2 id="Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat"><a href="#Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat" class="headerlink" title="Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat"></a><strong>Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat</strong></h2><p> We decided to compare the Ergodriven Topo against CubeFit’s TerraMat. Price-wise, they’re very similar, retailing around $100. They also come with massage mounds and various power wedges. However, the TerraMat has more features on the mat itself, including a balance bar and plantar mounds off to the sides, as well as a massage mound in the front. None of the actual features are located in the TerraMat’s center, unlike the Topo mat.</p><p> While the TerraMat may have more features for you, it also shows more dirt, which we found was a large turnoff, especially since you’re encouraged to use these mats sans shoes. We really didn’t like putting our feet onto a clearly dirty mat. The Ergodriven mat hides dirt and slides more easily across the floor than the TerraMat. If you prefer a mat that hides the dirt, but still comes with the main stretching features, we recommend the Ergodriven. However, if you want all the bells and whistles to a standing desk mat, we think the TerraMat would be the better choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cubefit-terramat-review-4775307" >CubeFit TerraMat Standing Desk Mat Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Pricey, but solid for the features.</strong></p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice. While we think there are other, better mats out there, but the Topo does hide dirt better, and the deep rear wedges stretch the hamstrings more than most other models on the market. If you want a solid stretch, then the Ergodriven Topo is the best choice for you.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Topo Standing Desk Mat</li><li>Product Brand  Ergodriven</li><li>MPN  000101FBA_9103</li><li>Price  $99.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  26.2 x 29 x 2.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  Seven Years</li><li>Connectivity Options  None</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-much-money-do-youtubers-make-per-view/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved How Much Money Do YouTubers Make Per View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-expressive-photography-techniques-applying-motion-blur-to-faces/"><u>[New] Expressive Photography Techniques Applying Motion Blur to Faces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamlined-recording-the-very-best-fullscreen-software/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamlined Recording The Very Best Fullscreen Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-expert-insights-into-tunefabs-recording-capabilities/"><u>[Updated] Expert Insights Into Tunefab's Recording Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-twittersphere-treasures-primes-top-watchers-and-likes/"><u>[Updated] Twittersphere Treasures Prime’s Top Watchers & Likes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2023s-elite-heart-beat-gadgets-a-comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-the-right-fitness-tracker/"><u>2023'S Elite Heart Beat Gadgets: A Comprehensive Guide to Choosing the Right Fitness Tracker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2023s-elite-selection-of-iphone-15-pro-max-skins-and-cases-reviewed-and-ranked/"><u>2023'S Elite Selection of iPhone 15 Pro Max Skins & Cases Reviewed and Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-success-steps-to-thriving-as-a-designer/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Success Steps to Thriving as a Designer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-proven-strategies-for-creating-superb-igtv-videos-on-smartphonesdlsrs/"><u>2024 Approved Proven Strategies for Creating Superb IGTV Videos on Smartphones/DLSRs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/antelope-valley-state-recreation-area-ft-kanzler-campgrounds/"><u>Antelope Valley State Recreation Area - Ft.

This hub is part of a suite of hubs that Amazon offers under the AmazonBasics brand, ranging from four-port to 10-port options. With this particular, 7-port flavor of their hubs, you get five regular USB 3.0 ports, and two fast-charge ports, capable of supplying more power.</p><p> The AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub definitely offers a lot of bang for your buck, but we have some quality control qualms that prevent this from being an instant recommendation.

The slanted body contains two connections on its left, one for the power and one for the USB-B port. On the back, you’ll find five standard USB 3.0 Type-A ports. The right side contains two fast-charge ports capable of supplying more than the standard power, so long as you’ve connected the hub to an outlet using the power cable. Finally, the top contains a simple blue LED, which lit up as soon as we connected the USB cable to the computer.</p><p> This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.</p><p> This design makes it a little awkward to connect your devices to it initially, but ultimately gives your desk a much cleaner look, and lets you drape your cables off the back of your desk, minimizing eyesores.</p><p> Plastic is used throughout the hub for its construction, including the front plate, which is designed to resemble brushed metal. This keeps the unit very light, which we’re sure is good for shipping purposes, but it also makes it feel a bit cheap and makes it easier to slide accidentally off your desk.</p><p> There were two quality control mishaps on the particular unit we tested. First, the internal ports were somewhat misaligned with the outer casing, making it difficult to plug in some devices. Second, the labels that should be printed around the ports didn’t make it onto this particular unit, despite all the product page images showing this feature. Not a huge deal, but also not a ringing endorsement for the device’s quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-6zArDEXr2_gqDvtkeqZAbTQKiQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics_UsbHubs_3LW4142295_05-c3e5d946a7e84b6cb1b395cff1103e42.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-trouble-at-all"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-trouble-at-all" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No trouble at all"></a><strong>Setup Process: No trouble at all</strong></h2><p> To begin using the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub, remove the main hub from its packaging and connect the supplied USB (A-to-B) cable to both the hub and your computer.

This should be sufficient for most users, and worked well in our setup. An AC power adapter is included as well, and it comes with a fairly substantial power brick.</p><p> The hub provides seven USB 3.0 Gen 1 ports, offering a maximum transfer speed of 5Gbps.

The five ports in the back supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the ports on the side, designed for fast charging, can supply up to 1.5A.

Buyers looking for a bit more might consider AUKEY’s 10-port powered hub or Amazon’s own AmazonBasics 10 Ports USB 3.0 Charging Hub Docking Station.

The measurements from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >previous generation 13-inch MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> remain virtually unchanged, measuring a modest 0.6x12x8.5 inches (HWD) and weighing in at 3 pounds. It’s just light enough that you can confidently carry it while open from room to room when life inevitably makes an impromptu appearance on your Zoom meeting.</p><p> In addition to the vast array of improvements, this year’s model addresses many of the lingering complaints people have had about the MacBook Pro for years. This MacBook Pro relies on a heat sink and passive cooling, just like the iPad, which has the added benefit of addressing one of the long-standing problems of noise by quieting the laptop even while under load. Impressively, it didn’t run hot even under load, but more on that below.</p><p> The MacBook Pro features two Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB 4 ports that support charging, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 3.1 Gen 2. If you want additional slots like an SD card reader of USB ports, you’ll need to use a USB-C hub.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Keyboard-A-great-typing-and-productivity-experience"><a href="#Keyboard-A-great-typing-and-productivity-experience" class="headerlink" title="Keyboard: A great typing and productivity experience"></a>Keyboard: A great typing and productivity experience</h2><p> If you’ve used a MacBook keyboard recently, you’ll know what to expect here as they still use the scissor-type switches. The keys are a backlit chiclet-style design with low travel distance. I initially thought that the keyboard might be too crowded, and while making the leap from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-17-inch-laptops-832683" >17-inch laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> layout to a 13-inch initially seemed pretty drastic, my fingers quickly acclimated to the smaller layout without too many missteps.</p><p> One key addition is so small that you’d miss it unless the touch bar deliberately pointed it out when you needed to log in. That is the new fingerprint sensor planted on the top-right corner of the keyboard that allows you to quickly log in, or use Apple Pay without the need for a password. While the functionality ends there, it does thankfully work quite well. I never encountered any issues trying to get the scanner to read, and using it quickly became second nature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lK3rf00vNHfwVLaFF5D2swcqn_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Macbook_Pro_M1_2020_02-a8fa9e03fafd477fb2423dfa9453b1bb.jpg"                      alt="MacBook Pro 13-inch"                ></p><p> Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Touchpad-A-soft-touch"><a href="#Touchpad-A-soft-touch" class="headerlink" title="Touchpad: A soft touch"></a>Touchpad: A soft touch</h2><p> While it didn’t feel mushy, the “barely-there” haptic response on the touchpad initially left me wishing for something a little punchier. But Apple has done quite a bit more than just provide us with a large singular button here.</p><p> Certainly not a new addition by any means, but the multi-point, pressure-sensitive trackpad paves the way for some interesting tricks that would otherwise be impossible. For example, bringing your fingers to a point and spreading them out in a starburst pattern causes all of your windows to be cleverly pushed aside, revealing the desktop. Pinch those fingers inward again and all the windows return to their original position. The gestures do take a little getting used to, but once you’ve mastered them, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.</p><p> At the end of the day, this functionality gives you a reason to use the touchpad as your first choice, rather than just constantly wishing you had a mouse or trackball close at hand.</p><p> The display can hit an impressive 500 nits of brightness, features rich, accurate colors, and great viewing angles.</p><h2 id="Display-Here’s-looking-at-you"><a href="#Display-Here’s-looking-at-you" class="headerlink" title="Display: Here’s looking at you"></a>Display: Here’s looking at you</h2><p> Apple continues to deliver with its 13-inch 2560x1600 Retina display, but this time with the True Tone technology that premiered on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and has been present on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tablets-to-buy-4036560" >every generation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since. This interesting bit of tech uses four different sensors to automatically adjust the white balance on your display based on your current lighting environment. This technology isn’t about increasing resolution and cramming in more pixels per inch, but sharpening color clarity and accuracy to a razor’s edge to provide the truest image possible.</p><p> The display can hit an impressive 500 nits of brightness, features rich, accurate colors, and great viewing angles. Another noteworthy improvement is the remarkably slim bezel on the 13-inch display, which lends a slick futuristic look to the laptop and gives you just a little more usable real-estate on your screen without increasing the size of the device itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-G_75srm3Qddt1nvHSP6rMO7yyc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Macbook_Pro_M1_2020_05-10007afca69547238297d4135852b975.jpg"                      alt="MacBook Pro 13-inch"                ></p><p> Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Performance-Get-up-and-go"><a href="#Performance-Get-up-and-go" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Get up and go"></a>Performance: Get up and go</h2><p> As a lifelong PC user and Mac skeptic, I was continually astounded with the whip-smart responsiveness and performance of Apple’s new laptop. The model I tested had 16GB RAM and a 2TB SSD, giving me plenty of storage and RAM for multitasking and productivity, but there are cheaper configurations available.</p><p> There are a number of noteworthy improvements under the hood however that make this MacBook worth talking about, most notably, Apple’s new M1 processor. With its 8 cores, it has speeds that surpass most conventional<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >ultrabooks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is all the more impressive considering that this is the first MacBook that doesn’t use a third-party CPU.</p><p> While gaming is hardly the first thing that comes to mind when purchasing a MacBook, I was surprised to find the MacBook more than holding its own in gaming benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance offered by many Windows ultrabooks like the HP Spectre x360. I was able to run Starcraft 2 on medium settings without any noticeable hitches or frame rate drops.</p><p> This year’s MacBook represents the best value we’ve seen in an Apple laptop for some time.</p><p> If you’re curious about the metrics, we’ve included a breakdown that shows how the new MacBook Pro stacks up against an HP Spectre x360 configuration of a similar price in terms of processing performance using Geekbench 5.</p><p><strong>HP x360 Spectre Convertible 15</strong></p><ul><li>Single Core: 1060</li><li>Multi-Core: 4716</li><li>OpenCL Compute: 21703</li></ul><p><strong>MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1)</strong></p><ul><li>Single Core: 1720</li><li>Multi-Core: 7552</li><li>OpenCL:19421</li></ul><p> The Spectre x360 does have a small leg up thanks to its dedicated GPU, but in terms of raw processing power and speed, the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip is the laptop to beat.</p><p> This shift represents an effort on the part of Apple to prove that it can once again innovate in the realm of computing now that it has more control over the overall architecture being used in its systems. While this new silicon boasts some truly impressive boosts to performance overall, there is a small drawback in that some apps that you lean on for productivity may not be fully optimized to work with the M1, even with the improvements brought by Big Sur.</p><h2 id="Battery-This-fruit-has-juice"><a href="#Battery-This-fruit-has-juice" class="headerlink" title="Battery: This fruit has juice"></a>Battery: This fruit has juice</h2><p> Another of the more noticeable improvements to the MacBook Pro is the extended battery life. I’m happy to report that in my testing, running a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> movie at maximum brightness on loop, it took the MacBook a little over 18 hours to deplete its charge. This makes Apple’s latest laptop one of the best laptops for battery life currently available. What’s even more amazing is how quickly it can be topped off. From being completely drained, we were able to boot up and get fully charged using the included adapter in just under an hour and a half.</p><p> I was surprised to find the MacBook more than holding its own in gaming benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance offered by many Windows ultrabooks like the HP Spectre x360.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886044/19272" target="_top" id="1886044">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886044" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886044/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Big-Sur-optimized-better-than-ever"><a href="#Software-Big-Sur-optimized-better-than-ever" class="headerlink" title="Software: Big Sur optimized better than ever"></a>Software: Big Sur optimized better than ever</h2><p> The M1 chip also allows the MacBook to run apps that are normally reserved for iPadOS. While this doesn’t necessarily sound all that exciting on paper, it does open up some interesting possibilities. This greatly expands the software library available to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-macos-4691239" >MacOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and helps to corral all of Apple’s hardware into a singular ecosystem.</p><p> The new MacBook can still use applications built on the Intel x86 architecture like Slack and Chrome through the built-in Rosetta 2 emulator almost seamlessly. Of course, it isn’t quite as fast as native applications, but any slowdown is hardly noticeable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975802/19272" target="_top" id="1975802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975802/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-bargain-at-twice-the-price"><a href="#Price-A-bargain-at-twice-the-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bargain at twice the price"></a>Price: A bargain at twice the price</h2><p> Starting at $1,299, going all the way up to $2,300 for the highest-end configuration, the MacBook Pro with the M1 processor offers incredible value. By comparison, a 13-inch MacBook that uses a 10th gen intel processor costs roughly $400 more and can’t really match the performance offered by the M1 CPU. Adopting this new hardware also seems to have cut away much of the premium we see associated with Apple products, achieving price parity with many of the ultrabooks outside of the Apple ecosystem.</p><p> For instance, an HP x360 Spectre with a similar performance configuration will cost around the same as an M1 MacBook. This isn’t carte blanche to just bin the MacBook you bought last year but this year’s MacBook represents the best value we’ve seen in an Apple laptop for some time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/laPPg5mKf354wXXqoaU3Vz_jRuM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Macbook_Pro_M1_2020_04-4d24391cc1a74240a35da5017f4f6a79.jpg"                      alt="MacBook Pro 13-inch"                ></p><p> Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Apple-MacBook-Pro-M1-vs-HP-Spectre-x360"><a href="#Apple-MacBook-Pro-M1-vs-HP-Spectre-x360" class="headerlink" title="Apple MacBook Pro (M1) vs. HP Spectre x360"></a>Apple MacBook Pro (M1) vs. HP Spectre x360</h2><p> The HP Spectre x360 does offer slightly more flexibility at a similar price point, thanks to Windows. But even the latest 10th Gen i7 Intel processors really can’t match the performance of the new Apple CPUs. The x360 is a slightly more robust machine, in terms of both size and hardware, incorporating more RAM, more storage, and a beefier GPU for better gaming performance. Unfortunately, the extra hardware makes the x360 much heavier, as well as making it run substantially warmer and louder when under load. The extra hardware is also more demanding of the battery, giving the x360 a drastically reduced battery life when compared to the MacBook Pro.</p><p> The new MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has plenty to love, especially for anyone thoroughly invested in the Apple ecosystem. While the M1 chip is easily the biggest selling point, the TrueTone display, TouchID sensor, and drastically improved thermal performance and battery life are just icing on the cake. However, it’s a bit disappointing to see such a shortage of connectivity options when compared to the array of ports available on the Spectre x360. HP includes everything from a microSD card slot to an HDMI port, but the MacBook Pro only has a pair of USB-C connections, pretty much forcing you to use an external USB-C hub unless you’re keen to constantly swap out cables.</p><p> Ultimately, if you’re a legacy MacBook owner and have no intention of changing, then now is an ideal time to upgrade to the latest iteration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. However, if you’re willing to change ecosystems (not many people are) The HP Spectre x360 is a slightly more versatile option that’s available for around the same price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-spectre-x360-15t-touch-laptop-review-4773540" >HP Spectre x360 15t Touch Laptop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Still need some more time before making a decision?

While there are some significant changes to last year’s model, you won’t be missing out on much if you’ve bought a new MacBook in the past year or two. However, if you’ve been biding your time for several generations, waiting for a substantial upgrade for your MacBook Pro, we can unequivocally say that the time is now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (2020) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-4-review-5091874" >Apple iPad Air 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  APZ11BMYD808</li><li>Price  $1,299.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Product Dimensions  0.61 x 11.97 x 8.36 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  90-day tech support, 1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  MacOS</li><li>Processor  Apple M1 CPU</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  2TB SSD</li><li>Camera  720p FaceTime HD</li><li>Battery Capacity  58.2 Wh</li><li>Ports  2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-your-journey-into-the-world-of-funny-metaverse-images-for-2024/"><u>[New] Your Journey Into the World of Funny Metaverse Images for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-free-high-quality-edits-explore-these-9-cloud-apps/"><u>[Updated] Free, High-Quality Edits Explore These 9 Cloud Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/authentication-error-occurred-on-vivo-v30-pro-here-are-10-proven-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Authentication Error Occurred on Vivo V30 Pro?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Rexing V1 DashCam is a great choice if you’re in the market for a security-style dashboard camera. Its size and shape are more suited to windshield mounting than other models we tested, plus it captures high-definition footage, decent sound, and is an overall reliable device.</p><p> It has all the additional features you’d expect from a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-dash-cameras-534889" >dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like loop recording and crash detection, and even some unique ones like timelapse recording. If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094429/7443" target="_top" id="2094429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094429/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident.

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.

It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925473/19272" target="_top" id="1925473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925473/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp; Internet Functionality  Internet video playback, WEB browsing</li><li>Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, LAN, Wi-Fi</li><li>Bluetooth Version  Bluetooth 5.0</li><li>Platform  LG ThinQ AI, webOS</li><li>Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Screen Size  65 inches</li><li>Type  OLED</li><li>Refresh Rate  120 Hz</li><li>Display Format  4k UHD (2160p)</li><li>HDR Technology  4K Cinema HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG)</li><li>Ports  4 HDMI 2.1 Ports, 3 USB Ports</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos 2.2 Channel 40 Watts</li><li>Additional Audio Features  Bluetooth audio streaming, Intelligent Voice Recognition, LG Sound Sync</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-mastering-free-picture-quality-enhancement-techniques/"><u>[New] Mastering Free Picture Quality Enhancement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-retweeted-gifs-iphoneandroid-step-by-step-savings/"><u>[New] Retweeted Gifs IPhone/Android Step-by-Step Savings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-precision-editing-perfecting-the-art-of-fades-in-pro/"><u>2024 Approved Precision Editing Perfecting the Art of Fades in Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-blueprint-for-traffic-boost-masterful-techniques-for-effective-fb-videos/"><u>2024 Approved The Blueprint for Traffic Boost Masterful Techniques for Effective FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-the-poweradd-pilot-pro2-multi-device-charger-is-it-worth-the-hype/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of the POWERADD Pilot Pro2 Multi-Device Charger - Is It Worth The Hype?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-the-economical-effective-rexing-v1-dash-cam/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Economical, Effective Rexing V1 Dash Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-withings-move-smartwatch-evaluation-timeless-design-meets-modern-tech/"><u>Comprehensive Withings Move Smartwatch Evaluation – Timeless Design Meets Modern Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/deciding-between-a-macbook-air-and-macbook-pro-detailed-comparison-guide/"><u>Deciding Between a MacBook Air and MacBook Pro: Detailed Comparison Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/dissecting-the-little-dragon-with-big-impact-a-review-of-spyro-reignited-trilogy/"><u>Dissecting the Little Dragon with Big Impact: A Review of Spyro Reignited Trilogy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/diving-into-the-world-of-amazon-halo-a-fitness-tracker-that-blurs-boundaries-for-a-comprehensive-self-monitoring-experience/"><u>Diving Into the World of Amazon Halo – A Fitness Tracker That Blurs Boundaries for a Comprehensive Self-Monitoring Experience.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/guarantee-the-security-of-your-valuables-online-with-these-5-data-preservation-tactics/"><u>Guarantee the Security of Your Valuables Online with These 5 Data Preservation Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-sweep-away-delayed-input-fasten-your-fingers-for-windows-11/"><u>How to Sweep Away Delayed Input: Fasten Your Fingers for Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-echoing-giggles-ultimate-ringtone-vaults/"><u>In 2024, Echoing Giggles Ultimate Ringtone Vaults</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-pro-level-perfection-iphone-xs-photographic-breakthroughs/"><u>In 2024, Pro-Level Perfection IPhone X's Photographic Breakthroughs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, with the decline of RTS games and my waning interest in FPS titles, I find controllers better suited for the types of games I enjoy most these days.</p><h2 id="3-A-Poor-Choice-for-Emulation"><a href="#3-A-Poor-Choice-for-Emulation" class="headerlink" title="3  A Poor Choice for Emulation"></a>3  A Poor Choice for Emulation</h2><p> While I’m not the greatest fan of <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-podcasters-handbook-writing-strategies-and-sample-scripts-available-free/" >emulators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I know many who are and they unanimously vote against the use of keyboards and mice for emulated games.</p><p> It makes sense when you think about it. When emulating a game, you’re recreating an experience originally designed for specific input devices, namely gamepads. It’s only logical that using a controller would offer the most authentic and enjoyable experience.</p><p> If you’re interested in emulation, there are various <a class="link"   href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-apple-id-verification-code-not-working-from-iphone-12-pro-by-drfone-ios/" >gamepads better suited for different types of emulated systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That said, most emulators allow you to remap buttons, so you can adapt a single gamepad to mimic different controller layouts.</p><h2 id="4-A-Lack-of-Vibration-Feedback"><a href="#4-A-Lack-of-Vibration-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="4  A Lack of Vibration Feedback"></a>4  A Lack of Vibration Feedback</h2><p> Let’s talk about something that keyboard and mouse setups sorely lack: <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >vibration feedback <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If your keyboard or mouse is vibrating, you might want to get that checked out. And if it’s battery-powered and vibrating, maybe step away slowly—we don’t want any surprise fireworks!</p><p> Jokes aside, the vibration feedback on a gamepad adds a whole new dimension to gaming. It’s not just about seeing and hearing; it’s about <em>feeling</em> the game.</p><p> Take <em>FIFA</em>, for instance. When I score a goal, and the controller vibrates, it amplifies the excitement of that moment. Or when I’m web-slinging through New York City as Spider-Man, the subtle vibrations as I swing and gain momentum make me feel like I’m really there, soaring between skyscrapers.</p><p> This is to say nothing of the modern haptic feedback seen on the PS5 DualSense controller with its adaptive triggers, and the rumble feedback that Xbox Core controllers feature in the triggers.</p><h2 id="5-Not-Ideal-for-Local-Co-op-or-PvP"><a href="#5-Not-Ideal-for-Local-Co-op-or-PvP" class="headerlink" title="5  Not Ideal for Local Co-op or PvP"></a>5  Not Ideal for Local Co-op or PvP</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/illustration-of-two-people-awkwardly-trying-to-share-a-single-keyboard-and-mouse-setup-for-gaming.png"                      alt="illustration of two people awkwardly trying to share a single keyboard and mouse setup for gaming."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Dibakar Ghosh &#x2F; How-To Geek | Midjourney</p><p> As a fan of hosting gaming sessions, I’ve found keyboard and mouse setups to be a real party pooper for <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-earnings-expertise-for-youtube-creators-fb-insights-and-tactics/" >local co-op <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or PvP. I mean, how do you even make that work?</p><p> You can’t have two people sharing one keyboard and mouse. So, inevitably, one person gets the keyboard and mouse while the other uses a gamepad. Boom! Instant uneven playing field.</p><p> Then there’s the logistical nightmare. If I’m on a keyboard and mouse, I need to be right in front of my PC. So where does my friend sit? Beside me, they’re looking at the screen at an awkward angle. Behind me, they’re basically watching the back of my head instead of the game. Granted, I have great hair, but that’s not the point.</p><p> I’ve experienced this first-hand with <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, my current go-to game for local multiplayer. But it translates to other titles like <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, or <em>Overcooked</em>. Trust me, you don’t want to play <em>Overcooked</em> with one person on a gamepad and another fumbling with a keyboard.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948895/19272" target="_top" id="1948895">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948895" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948895/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-I’m-Tied-to-My-Desk"><a href="#6-I’m-Tied-to-My-Desk" class="headerlink" title="6  I’m Tied to My Desk"></a>6  I’m Tied to My Desk</h2><p> Picture this: I’ve spent hours sitting at my desk, working away. When it’s finally time to unwind with some games, I’m faced with the prospect of either staying in that exact same spot or going somewhere else. My life can’t start and end at a desk.</p><p> What I really want is the freedom to scoot over to my comfy beanbag or sprawl out on the sofa and play my games, like <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-performers-playbook-avoiding-common-mistakes-in-ppt-voiceovers/" >that afforded by a handheld like the Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But with a keyboard and mouse setup, that’s just not an option. Playing games while balancing a keyboard on your knees and a mouse in front of the sofa doesn’t sound like a great time.</p><p> This is the main reason I decided to get a gamepad. I can easily grab my controller, plop down anywhere in my room, and start gaming.</p><h2 id="7-Breaks-My-Work-Discipline"><a href="#7-Breaks-My-Work-Discipline" class="headerlink" title="7  Breaks My Work Discipline"></a>7  Breaks My Work Discipline</h2><p> Most of us don’t have a gaming PC <em>and</em> an office PC, all we have is a PC. On this system, we do our work and we play our games, which is just a recipe for procrastination. I can’t count how many times I jumped into a gaming session because I had to do some work that was boring or tiring. I thought a quick gaming session would clear my mind, but all it did was tick away an hour or two of the workday.</p><p> I’m not blaming the keyboard and mouse entirely, though it did seem like the call of a siren sometimes. However, after switching to a gamepad for gaming (and gradually preferring it over a keyboard and mouse), I noticed a boost in my productivity.</p><p> By associating gaming with a gamepad and keeping it out of sight during work hours, I created just enough friction to resist sneaking into quick gaming sessions when work got challenging. I established a clear boundary: work mode is a keyboard and mouse, and play mode is a gamepad. It’s simple, effective, and <a class="link"   href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/the-insiders-guide-to-captivating-youtube-headlines/" >keeps me disciplined <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896510/19272" target="_top" id="1896510">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896510" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896510/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Because-I-Love-My-Keyboard-and-Mouse"><a href="#8-Because-I-Love-My-Keyboard-and-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="8  Because I Love My Keyboard and Mouse"></a>8  Because I Love My Keyboard and Mouse</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-of-keyboard-and-mouse-of-a-deskpad.jpg"                      alt="Image of Keyboard and Mouse of a Deskpad."                > </p><p>Ismar Hrnjicevic &#x2F; How-To Geek  </p><p> This is not as contradictory as it sounds. I cherish my keyboard and mouse for work, which is precisely why I avoid using them for gaming. They’re essential tools for my livelihood, and I’d rather keep them safe from the rigors of intense gaming sessions.</p><p> I’ve lost keyboards to button-mashing in action-packed games. Even <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/social-sensation-best-insta-stories-effects/" >switching to mechanical keyboards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> didn’t solve the issue entirely. Imagine trying to write an article when <em>thespacebarstopsworking</em>. Frustrating, right? Even my mouse’s left-click got a bit mushy and unresponsive.</p><p> My <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/streamlining-visual-storytelling-with-youtube-videos-for-2024/" >current mechanical keyboard has hot-swappable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> switches, so technically, if a key falters, I can pull it out and replace it. However, considering this and all the above points, it’s just more convenient to have a dedicated gamepad for gaming while preserving my keyboard and mouse for work.</p><h2 id="9-A-Spare-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Will-Take-Up-Too-Much-Desk-Space"><a href="#9-A-Spare-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Will-Take-Up-Too-Much-Desk-Space" class="headerlink" title="9  A Spare Keyboard and Mouse Will Take Up Too Much Desk Space"></a>9  A Spare Keyboard and Mouse Will Take Up Too Much Desk Space</h2><p> Before you write in the comments, “Dude, just use a separate keyboard and mouse for gaming,” well, I tried that. My first attempt was to install a keyboard tray under my desk. It didn’t work out—the tray restricted leg movement, which is a no-go for someone with <a class="link"   href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168" >restless leg syndrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> I even considered a <a class="link"   href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-innovative-question-collection-for-lively-podcast-discussions/" >compact, one-handed gaming keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a separate mouse, but desk space is precious. I need room for notebooks, pens, and other essentials. Cramming two sets of peripherals in wasn’t worth it compared to the simplicity of a gamepad.</p><p> That said, those one-handed keyboards are actually really cool and might work well for those who primarily use their PC for gaming and want that classic gamer aesthetic. I can see myself using it if I played RTS or FPS games and had an even wider desk for all my other stuff.</p><hr><p> For many PC gamers, ditching the keyboard and mouse for a controller is like trading in your sports car for a simple sedan. But sometimes, the comfort and ergonomics of a sedan are exactly what you need.</p><p> Sure, I won’t be topping any leaderboards in <em>Valorant</em> or micromanaging armies in <em>Starcraft</em> using a controller, but I’m having a blast playing my favorite games from the comfort of my couch without the fear of carpal tunnel or a busted Space bar.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-freeplayvid-seamless-recording-for-the-avid-player/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved FreePlayVid Seamless Recording for the Avid Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-cutting-edge-beat-detection-for-aspiring-producers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Free, Cutting-Edge Beat Detection for Aspiring Producers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-art-of-intense-focus-5-techniques-for-zooming-in-minecraft/"><u>2024 Approved The Art of Intense Focus 5 Techniques for Zooming in Minecraft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/amazon-luna-review/"><u>Amazon Luna Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-on-nulaxy-km18-car-fm-transmitter-last-gens-reliable-performer/"><u>Comprehensive Guide on Nulaxy KM18 Car FM Transmitter - Last Gen's Reliable Performer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-how-the-lenovo-tab-m10-hd-202e-transforms-web-browsing-and-media-streaming-for-less-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Discover How the Lenovo Tab M10 HD (202E) Transforms Web Browsing and Media Streaming for Less: A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-samsung-galaxy-a05s-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track a Lost Samsung Galaxy A05s for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-realme-11-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Realme 11 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-telegram-spy-tools-on-samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-for-parents-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Telegram Spy Tools On Samsung Galaxy A54 5G for Parents | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-budget-friendly-samsung-galaxy-s10e-compact-yet-captivating/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Budget-Friendly Samsung Galaxy S10e: Compact Yet Captivating</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Set Your Preferred Job Location on LinkedIn App of your Samsung Galaxy S23 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-budget-friendly-and-portable-microsoft-surface-laptop-go-reviewed-a-competitive-entry-into-ultrabooks/"><u>The Budget-Friendly and Portable Microsoft Surface Laptop Go Reviewed: A Competitive Entry Into Ultrabooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-lg-oled-c9-65-inch-4k-television-unveiling-the-ultimate-home-entertainment-center/"><u>The Definitive Guide to LG OLED C9 65-Inch 4K Television - Unveiling the Ultimate Home Entertainment Center</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/ultimate-test-and-analysis-of-the-mavix-m9-gamers-throne-unmatched-comfort-on-extended-play-sessions/"><u>Ultimate Test and Analysis of the Mavix M9 Gamer's Throne: Unmatched Comfort on Extended Play Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/ultimate-windows-clean-up-stellar-file-deleter-5-optimized-for-safe-file-and-folder-removal/"><u>Ultimate Window's Clean-Up: Stellar File Deleter 5 - Optimized for Safe File & Folder Removal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-of-upgrading-from-windows-7-to-10/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets of Upgrading From Windows 7 To 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unveiling-why-the-wii-u-became-a-noteworthy-success-story/"><u>Unveiling Why The Wii U Became A Noteworthy Success Story</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Curved TVs haven’t caught on in a big way, given that the vast majority of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >4K HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sets sold today are still flat. Still, curved-screen sets are out there if you want something a little different, or perhaps something that provides a supposedly more immersive viewing experience. These days, Samsung is really the only brand-name manufacturer still pumping out new curved sets in North America, with a range of sizes and prices available.</p><p> Samsung’s 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is on the lower end of that price scale, with an MSRP of $550, but seen on sale for less than $500. It’s a sharp-looking set, given the high-resolution 4K image, and the curved design is appealing—although it comes with the same set of limitations and complications as any curved TV screen.</p><p> Lacking brightness holds it back a bit, minimizing the effect of HDR, but this is still a pretty nice set for the price, assuming that you’re fixated on a curved screen. I tested Samsung’s RU7300 for more than 80 hours across streaming media, video games, movies, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LtRcWBwD090kcd6bXSRbOUiTiLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_02-2035b246c96446388cc49504b68842ba.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014848/22899" target="_top" id="2014848">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014848" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014848/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-An-appealing-arc"><a href="#Design-An-appealing-arc" class="headerlink" title="Design: An appealing arc"></a><strong>Design: An appealing arc</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a bit more visual pop than your average<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >large-screen 4K HDR set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because it is physically popping out towards you on the right and left sides, unlike a standard flat television. It’s a subtle curve overall, but enough to be just noticeable—especially from the sides. That might make it an awkward fit for wall mounting, but it has a distinctive edge that’s unlike nearly every other TV you’ll find in stores.</p><p> Curves aside, Samsung went pretty minimal on the front of the set, with a black plastic frame that’s nearly uniform around the screen—but slightly thicker on the bottom, with a tiny Samsung logo sitting on a small metallic accent at the center. The two legs strike a wide stance on either end, and aren’t especially chunky.</p><p> Meanwhile, the back of the TV has a series of uneven ridged horizontal stripes that are attractive. You’ll find the array of ports here, split between two panels. There are three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an optical audio out, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and hybrid component&#x2F;AV cables for older devices. That should be plenty for your various devices, although some TVs around this price point pack in another<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The included remote control is compact, but filled with all of the buttons you’ll need to navigate menus, tap in channel numbers, and reach your favorite streaming services. It has dedicated buttons for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video right on the remote, plus there are four programmable, color-coded A-D buttons for favorite channels. The TV itself also has a small control nub underneath the Samsung logo, but it’s difficult to feel around for and use.</p><p> Low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall"><a href="#Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Legs or wall"></a><strong>Setup Process: Legs or wall</strong></h2><p> If you’re setting the Samsung RU7300 up on a stand or table, then you’ll need to install the legs. That is extremely straightforward: each is designated for a certain side and simply requires popping in and tightening a couple of screws. Meanwhile, if you opt for wall-mounting, you’ll need a standard VESA 200x200 mount—however, you may need longer screws. The screws on my existing wall mount (for a flat-screen TV) weren’t long enough, so I had to order specialized ones.</p><p> Initial software setup can take a few minutes, as you’ll be prompted to log into a Wi-Fi network if you don’t have an Ethernet cable plugged into an active connection, and you may have to download updates to Samsung’s built-in interface. It was a pretty quick process for me.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder</strong></h2><p> At 3840x2160 (4K Ultra HD) resolution, Samsung’s RU7300 has sharpness covered, delivering crisply detailed visuals across the board. Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly. And low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><p> Samsung advertises HDR support here, but it doesn’t pack quite the same punch as on some other TVs in this price range. This curved set just doesn’t get immensely bright, so it’s difficult to see quite as much variance in the dynamic range. Watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 4K, it’s still inherently vibrant due to the source material, but lacks the extra edge in dynamism and contrast, and even looks a bit dim at times. The image quality isn’t bad in any way, but it doesn’t hit quite the peaks that I’d expected.</p><p> As for the curved design, it’s difficult to really see the advantages beyond wanting something a bit different from the pack. Whether playing games or watching movies or TV shows, I didn’t feel like the picture was any more immersive due to the slight arc of the display. But the curved screen does bring some notable downsides, such as ambient light more clearly reflecting off of the curves, and viewing angles suffering at wider angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GaFmEEESPt4pM-0PAQ3JifVZPOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_03-e3e60b2553d84a6cb6a03c52a94073a0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959764/19272" target="_top" id="1959764">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959764" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959764/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Totally solid sound"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Totally solid sound</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a pair of stereo speakers with a total output of 20W, and they’ll get the job done for everyday viewing of streaming shows and movies, and playing games. Playback is clear and full, although it’s not heavy on bass—and unlike a lot of other modestly-priced televisions, I wasn’t immediately itching for a soundbar. You’ll see an improvement from external speakers, certainly, but it doesn’t feel as necessary here.</p><h2 id="Software-Clean-but-incomplete"><a href="#Software-Clean-but-incomplete" class="headerlink" title="Software: Clean, but incomplete"></a><strong>Software: Clean, but incomplete</strong></h2><p> Samsung’s own<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tizen-4580383" >Tizen OS-based <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Smart Hub interface is used on this curved smart TV, providing easy access to streaming video apps and settings. Most of the heavy hitters are here, either already installed or available via the built-in app marketplace, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and even<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193" >Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are some omissions, however: both Twitch and Bravo were missing in action when I searched for them. Samsung also offers a number of free streaming channels in partnership with Pluto TV, in case you miss the sensation of flipping channels for something to watch.</p><p> Even with some popular apps missing, the interface is very clean and easy to use, taking up only a small chunk of space at the bottom of your screen when hunting for your next app so you can still see what you were already watching or playing. Sponsored ads for streaming video channels and newly-released movies might be annoying to some users, however.</p><p> Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly.</p><h2 id="Price-Curves-cost-extra"><a href="#Price-Curves-cost-extra" class="headerlink" title="Price: Curves cost extra"></a><strong>Price: Curves cost extra</strong></h2><p> There aren’t many curved televisions currently on the market, so it’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison. However, looking at other mid-range 4K HDR Smart TVs with flat screens, you can find numerous models for less cash than the $550 asking price of the RU7300. Still, the RU7300 has been selling for around $480 as of this writing, which is easier to stomach if you’re set on a curved screen.</p><h2 id="Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV"><a href="#Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV" class="headerlink" title="Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV"></a><strong>Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV</strong></h2><p> Here’s one example of how you can save a fair amount of cash by skipping the curved screen—and get a better TV in the process. Vizio’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-50-inch-4k-smart-tv-m507-g1-review-4842757" >M-Series Quantum 50-inch 4K HDR TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-50-class-led-m-series-quantum-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr/6345462.p?skuId=6345462" >Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a little smaller in size, sure, but not significantly so. Better yet, it delivers a brighter and more vibrant picture, with local dimming zones boosting the black levels.</p><p> They’re not significantly far apart in overall quality, but with the Vizio set priced at $400 and seen on sale for less, it shows that lower-priced sets can actually be an upgrade over this curved option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-48-inch-tvs-4138374" >Hisense 50H8F Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The curve isn’t essential, but it’s a solid mid-range TV if you can find it on sale.</strong></p><p> If you’re sold on a curved screen, whether it’s due to the distinctive nature or purported added level of immersiveness, then the Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is a pretty good mid-range choice. It’s more expensive than similarly-specced flat 4K HDR sets, but that’s the price you’ll pay for a significant niche feature. Samsung’s curved set comes up a little short on brightness, which impacts the quality of the HDR experience, but otherwise provides a nice-looking picture, responsive inputs, and a slick-looking interface.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  UN55RU7300FXZA 55-Inch 4KUHD 7 Series</li><li>Product Brand  Samsung</li><li>Price  $500.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2019</li><li>Product Dimensions  48.7 x 28.1 x 4.1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Resolution  3840x2160</li><li>HDR  Yes</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, 2x USB, Component Video, Optical, Coaxial, Ethernet, A&#x2F;V</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-future-sighted-the-foremost-cameras-excellence/"><u>[New] Future Sighted The Foremost Cameras Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-symphonic-switch-up-reimagining-your-musical-lists/"><u>[New] Symphonic Switch-Up Reimagining Your Musical Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-optimizing-video-playback-sizes-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Optimizing Video Playback Sizes on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-cinemagraph-guide-top-5-must-know-tactics/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Cinemagraph Guide - Top 5 Must-Know Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/canon-powershot-sx420-a-zoom-marvel-in-a-small-form/"><u>Canon PowerShot SX420: A Zoom Marvel in a Small Form</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-dell-xps-13-7390-the-perfect-fusion-of-elegance-and-functionality/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Dell XPS 13 (7390): The Perfect Fusion of Elegance and Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-netgear-nighthawk-x6-ac3200-the-ultimate-tri-band-wireless-router-for-high-speed-and-home-use/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 – The Ultimate Tri-Band Wireless Router for High Speed & Home Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-linksys-max-stream-ac1900-the-perfect-network-solution-for-all-users/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the Linksys Max-Stream AC1900: The Perfect Network Solution for All Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-philips-hf3520-clock-radio-value-meets-performance/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the Philips HF3520 Clock Radio: Value Meets Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-lg-k51-evaluation-gorgeous-presentation-counterbalanced-by-modest-processing-speed/"><u>Comprehensive LG K51 Evaluation: Gorgeous Presentation Counterbalanced by Modest Processing Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-lg-watch-style-examination-mastering-the-classic-wear-os-20-timepiece/"><u>Comprehensive LG Watch Style Examination - Mastering the Classic Wear OS 2.0 Timepiece</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/essential-skype-interview-techniques-the-ultimate-guide-to-success-in-2-2024/"><u>Essential Skype Interview Techniques: The Ultimate Guide to Success in 2지 2024년</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-ways-to-transfer-photos-from-itel-a60s-to-iphone-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Ways to Transfer Photos from Itel A60s to iPhone Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock a Samsung Galaxy A14 4G Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-5-speedy-shot-strategies-right-from-your-living-room/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate 5 Speedy Shot Strategies Right From Your Living Room</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> It’s difficult to go more than a few feet nowadays without coming across a power outlet (or at least a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), but on those rare occasions you’re away from any source of power, it’s nice to have a backup battery on hand for when your laptop or smartphone dies.</p><p> While there’s no shortage of options on the market, there aren’t many that can keep you going for days. That’s not the case with the MaxOak 50000mAh, an absolutely massive and robust charger that attempts to be the jack of all when it comes to charging gadgets on the go. It’s power comes at the cost of massive size and the charging ports aren’t too fast, but if you need tons of power, this is the battery pack to get.</p><h2 id="Design-Bulky-for-travelers"><a href="#Design-Bulky-for-travelers" class="headerlink" title="Design: Bulky for travelers"></a><strong>Design: Bulky for travelers</strong></h2><p> First and foremost, this thing is a tank. At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops. It also measures in at 8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 inches (HWD), making it quite the behemoth to lug around. A small detail regarding the weight of the MaxOak is that it isn’t balanced. The side without the ports holds a fair bit more weight than the side with the various ports. It’s not a significant detail, but one you might notice with time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SHsB9QkFaBbOrU6sw55TzNOqC7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_4Web-5c8ff4adc9e77c0001ff0b36.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> As for the materials, the metal enclosure and place ends give it a fairly solid feel, but the metal doesn’t sit perfectly flush with the plastic ends, at least not in our model. It could be a one-off quality control issue or it might simply be the way in which the charger is constructed, but it’s definitely noticeable.</p><p> The number of ports integrated into the charger is impressive. It includes four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032" >USB Type-A <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports—two 2.1A and two 1.0A—as well as two AC plug-in style connections—a 12-volt 2.5A plugin and a 20-volt 5.0A plugin. This offers a solid range of options for charging alongside the slew of connection<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-adapter-817585" >adapters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> MaxOak includes with the charger. That said, it would’ve been nice to see a USB Type-C port (or two) considering how ubiquitous they’re becoming.</p><p> At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops.</p><p> Charging the device is done via a small 16.8-volt 2.5A plug-in style port on the opposite side of the power button. Overall, the design is roughly what you’d expect from a 50000mAh laptop battery charger. Yes, it’s heavy, yes it’s quite beefy in size, but it comes with the territory.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around</strong></h2><p> Setting up the MaxOak laptop battery charger is as simple as it gets. After removing it from its unbranded cardboard box, it’s simply a matter of plugging it in and getting it charged up completely. Our device came charged at roughly 50% based on the onboard<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> battery indicator, but to complete our tests we wanted it charged entirely, which leads us to our biggest complaint about this charger.</p><p> The point of a charger is to have extra battery power on hand when needed so you don’t have to carry around unnecessary cables when traveling. Unfortunately, the MaxOak battery pack doesn’t use any kind of USB or standardized port. Rather than charging it with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even a micro-USB port, the MaxOak battery pack relies on its own proprietary power supply that’s nearly as large as most laptop chargers. Sure, the 50000mAh onboard is likely enough that you could leave both the battery pack charger and your laptop charger behind for most events, but eventually you’ll run out of juice and rather than reaching for a cable you would probably already have in your bag, you’re stuck bringing along a proprietary charger.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh manages to charge at a decent rate considering its capacity, but we would’ve liked to see more high-powered ports for speedier charging. We charged and fully drained the MaxOak power bank five times and charging took roughly six to eight hours per recharge with an average of seven hours and fifteen minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FlP4JZUVLoJ3DjKoSRUIFuf1peY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_6Web-5c8ff3e6c9e77c0001a926ff.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> One nice bonus is the power bank can be charged while also giving a charge to a laptop or mobile device, adding an extra element of convenience.</p><p> Charging the power bank itself is only one half of the equation though—and arguably the less important half. More importantly, is how well it can charge other devices.</p><p> At 50000mAh&#x2F;185Wh, the MaxOak power bank offers one of the highest capacities out there for a device of its size. For mobile devices, we tested it on both a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active as well as an iPhone XS. For laptops, we tested it with an ASUS X555LA notebook.</p><p> The MaxOak power bank charged the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active just shy of twelve times from 0% to 100%. This aligns almost exactly with the 50000mAh capacity of the MaxOak power divided by the 4,000mAh capacity of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. We experienced similar results with the iPhone XS. While Apple doesn’t specifically mention the battery capacity of the iPhone XS, third parties have reported it to be approximately 2,700mAh, which would equate to roughly 18.5 full charges. In our tests, we were able to get 17.5 charges from the MaxOak power bank.</p><p> Moving onto laptops, our ASUS X555LA was able to be charged four and a half times from 0% with the MaxOak power bank, with an average charge time of three hours or so. The ASUS X555LA has a relatively small battery compared to most laptops, which means it falls in line with MaxOak’s claims that its power bank can charge a laptop two times over give or take a little.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Right-down-the-middle"><a href="#Price-Right-down-the-middle" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right down the middle"></a><strong>Price: Right down the middle</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh power bank comes in at $135.99 at the time of this review.

Considering all three power banks appear to be identical to each other in capacity and accessories, the Renogy looks to be the best value.</p><p> Want to see how other brands compare?

However, it isn’t designed with newer computers and devices in mind. If you have an older laptop on hand that isn’t a MacBook (the MaxOak doesn’t support any MagSafe connectors) or doesn’t use USB Type-C for charging, it’ll get the job done. But if your smartphone or laptop is newer and relies on more recent and powerful connections, you’re going to want to look elsewhere.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jackery-powerbar-battery-pack-review-4589480" >Jackery PowerBar Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/chargetech-27000mah-battery-pack-review-4589409" >ChargeTech 27000mAh Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-powercore-26800-battery-pack-bundle-review-4589459" >Anker PowerCore+ 26800 Battery Pack Bundle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  185Wh&#x2F;50000mAh External Battery Power Bank</li><li>Product Brand  MAXOAK</li><li>Price  $135.99</li><li>Release Date  June 2015</li><li>Weight  2.77 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 in.</li><li>Color  Gunmetal</li><li>Removable Cables  Yes, included</li><li>Controls  Power button</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs  One DC20V 5A, one DC12V 2.5A, Four USB 5V</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  Android, iOS</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-learn-how-to-control-video-speed-on-snapchat-effectively-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Learn How to Control Video Speed on Snapchat Effectively for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-lava-yuva-3-pro-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Lava Yuva 3 Pro without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/google-play-services-wont-update-12-fixes-are-here-on-oppo-reno-8t-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Google Play Services Wont Update? 12 Fixes are Here on Oppo Reno 8T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-budding-filmmakers-companion-understanding-display-quality-101/"><u>In 2024, The Budding Filmmaker’s Companion Understanding Display Quality 101</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/1723016369439-logitech-g933-sound-issues-follow-these-quick-fixes/"><u>Logitech G933 Sound Issues?

class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Retro Controller in 2024"></a>What to Look For in a Retro Controller in 2024</h2><p> There are so many video game systems to choose from that the “perfect” controller doesn’t exist. If you want an authentic retro gaming experience, you’ll generally want a controller replicating the feel of playing retro games on the older system.</p><p> Starting with the NES generation of consoles, the controller became relatively standardized. If your general interest in retro gaming is from this era onward, buying a single gamepad that adequately covers multiple systems is possible.</p><p> That includes the modern controllers you already have, but they have a major flaw that makes them less than ideal for retro gaming. Specifically, they tend to have mushy D-pads.</p><p> Most retro games extensively use the D-pad to control the game. Modern games use the D-pad for tasks such as using items or switching between in-game modes—so they don’t need to be as accurate. Therefore, a good retro controller must first have a sharp, accurate d-pad with good feedback.</p><p> The next thing to look for is compatibility. Most modern retro controllers will work with anything that has Bluetooth or USB, but only a select few are compatible with original hardware. In this article, we’re not specifically looking for controllers to use with the original consoles, but some offer this option as a bonus.</p><p> Finally, button layout and quality are paramount. If you want to play a game designed for a controller with six face buttons, using one with just four can be an issue. Buttons also need to be comfortable enough and give good sharp feedback. In retro games, button presses tend to be more frequent and intense, so any controller has to stand up to this.</p><p> With a laser focus on making retro games play as well and authentically as possible, let’s look at some of the best retro-style controllers you can buy.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It has all of the controls for retro gaming up to the modern 3D era, where analog sticks came onto the scene.</p><p> Although it lacks the six-face buttons <a class="link"   href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/download-the-latest-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-software-for-windows/" >Genesis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or fighting game fans would prefer, it does come with two additional back buttons, so you can compensate for that when mapping buttons for these titles.

Of course, the biggest change is the somewhat short 5.6-foot cord, which ends in a standard USB-A plug for compatibility with Raspberry Pi, Windows, Mac, and Linux. You’ll have no issue diving into your classic NES library, and enjoying favorites like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, and so many more.</p><p> If you’ve never held a classic NES controller, you likely won’t realize the Suily version feels a little cheaper. Though the mold is fairly accurate to the original model, its construction could use a little updating. So long as you’re not rough on your controllers, this USB-enabled NES controller should serve you well.</p><p> Because the controller only has two face buttons, the biggest limitation is in the library it works with. However, if you’re only playing NES games, it’s a wonderful way to feel like you’ve stepped back in time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/suily-nes-controller.png"                      alt="Suily NES controller"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best NES-Style Controller</p><h5 id="Suily-NES-USB-Controller-1"><a href="#Suily-NES-USB-Controller-1" class="headerlink" title="Suily NES USB Controller"></a>Suily NES USB Controller</h5><p>If you’re looking for a recreation of the classic NES days, Suily delivers with a near 1:1 replica of the iconic controller that helped truly launch at-home family gaming.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-suily-Joystick-RetroPie-Emulators/dp/B07M7SYX11?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205804&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/807828/best-retro-controller/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$16 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-SNES-Style-Controller-8Bitdo-SN30-Pro-Wireless-Bluetooth-Controller"><a href="#Best-SNES-Style-Controller-8Bitdo-SN30-Pro-Wireless-Bluetooth-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Best SNES-Style Controller: 8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller"></a>Best SNES-Style Controller: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Vibration-Compatible-Mac/dp/B0BW3T9YBP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205804&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/807828/best-retro-controller/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8bitdo-sn30-pro-wireless-bluetooth-controller.png"                      alt="8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087395/7443" target="_top" id="2087395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>8Bitdo</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Super cool transparent design</td><td>✗ Motion controls for Switch users only</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Wireless</td><td>✗ A little bit pricier than some alternatives</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Four shoulder buttons</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Turbo Function</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Taking everything great about the 8Bitdo SN30 and then dialing up to eleven, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Vibration-Compatible-Mac/dp/B0BW3T9YBP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205804&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/807828/best-retro-controller/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a premium SNES-style controller compatible with Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi. </p><p> This 2023 version of the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro features an ultra-cool crystal purple transparent design that mimics the classic SNES controller layout but with four additional shoulder buttons.

Retro-Bit captured the Genesis controller’s classic look and felt with this original replication.</p><p> The six face buttons are there, as is the signature curve that may take a moment to get used to. Two shoulder buttons add a hint of customization so you can easily pull off some specials in <em>Mortal Kombat</em> with just the click of a button.</p><p> Retro-Bit went with a long 10-foot USB-A cable compatible with Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi, and Linux. You may find the D-pad a little flimsy if you’re rougher on your controllers or take fighting games seriously. Otherwise, the construction is durable and light without feeling cheap.</p><p> A small “Mode” button at the center swaps between <a class="link"   href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-your-creativity-top-10-free-video-editors-for-mp4-files/" >D-input and X-input <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which expands the library of compatible titles.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The inexpensive webcam makes it possible for just about anyone to make a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apps-for-free-video-chat-3426695" >video call, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stream games on Twitch, or to record a quick video for YouTube. A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/86PZ5XCiq91ihr7-8UNmM5io9pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_4_Final_Horiz-bad356a5002b4156859dca672e8a8eb4.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flexible-foldable-design"><a href="#Design-Flexible-foldable-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flexible, foldable design"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>Flexible, foldable design</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1610918/18409" target="_top" id="1610918">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1610918" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1610918/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

But there’s a reason it retails so cheaply; it’s a nightmare to use, the audio quality is torturous, and the camera doesn’t approach the advertised 12 MP. Despite being nearly $60 more expensive, the C615 is the obvious winner here.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-review-4784227" >Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>Genius 120-degree Webcam</em> :</strong> The Genius 120-degree Webcam is a full HD model with a wide-angle lens. Even though its actual field of view is well short of the advertised 120 degrees (in reality, it’s closer to 90), it still captures a much wider shot than the Logitech C615, giving it a clear advantage for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with large groups of people.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Play-Classic-Games-Anywhere-RetroArch-Compatible-with-iOS-Devices-Apple-TV"><a href="#Play-Classic-Games-Anywhere-RetroArch-Compatible-with-iOS-Devices-Apple-TV" class="headerlink" title="Play Classic Games Anywhere: RetroArch Compatible with iOS Devices &amp; Apple TV"></a>Play Classic Games Anywhere: RetroArch Compatible with iOS Devices &amp; Apple TV</h2><p>Step aside, no-name emulation apps. RetroArch is now available on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. It’s free to use, it doesn’t contain ads, and it supports both touchscreen and controller input.</p><p> Apple recently adjusted its guidelines to allow retro game emulators on the App Store. <a class="link"   href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-mac-use-top-5-recommended-sniping-apps/" >Delta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was the first emulator to really make a splash, and now, we’ve got both <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retroarch/id6499539433" >RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903" >PPSSPP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. RetroArch isn’t <em>actually</em> an emulator—instead, it’s a frontend that loads emulators for over a dozen well-known and obscure consoles. You can hop from Nintendo DS and PlayStation games to Bandai WonderSwan and Neo Geo Pocket titles, for example.</p><p> However, there are <em>a lot</em> of quirks here. Transferring files into RetroArch is one such quirk—the app is sandboxed and cannot pull files from other directories (though the iPad version can access iCloud). So, on iOS, you need to manually create a games folder in the RetroArch directory and place your ROMs there. If you’re doing this on Apple TV, you need to transfer your ROMs though a web interface. The URL for the web interface appears at the top of your TV screen.</p><p> You’ll also need to run the Online Updater after first opening RetroArch, as it’s missing a few assets by default (admittedly, this is a common problem with RetroArch). More frustratingly, some emulation cores are absent from this release. Only in-house cores and those that were previously approved for third-party marketplaces are included in RetroArch on iOS and tvOS. GameCube and 3DS emulation are barred from this release, for now.</p><p> If RetroArch emulation is running too fast on your device, it’s because the emulator isn’t syncing its content to your device’s refresh rate. You can fix the problem by opening “Settings,” selecting “Video,” pressing “Synchronization,” and selecting “Sync to Exact Content Framerate.”</p><p> Go <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retroarch/id6499539433" >download RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the App Store today. Be sure to check that you’re installing the correct app, as there’s a lot of garbage on the App Store right now. I also suggest reading through RetroArch’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/comments/1cspcb7/retroarch%5Fis%5Flive%5Fon%5Fthe%5Fapp%5Fstore/" >Reddit thread <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has basically turned into a troubleshooting session. RetroArch <em>does</em> have a <a class="link"   href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/install-ios/#using-retroarch" >guide for iOS and tvOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it was written for sideloading, rather than App Store installation, so it isn’t up to date.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/comments/1cspcb7/retroarch%5Fis%5Flive%5Fon%5Fthe%5Fapp%5Fstore/" >RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-ignite-your-narratives-complimentary-fb-apps-for-everyday-users-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ignite Your Narratives Complimentary FB Apps for Everyday Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-harness-the-power-of-speech-to-text-in-google-documents/"><u>In 2024, Harness the Power of Speech-to-Text in Google Documents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-poco-m6-pro-4g-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Poco M6 Pro 4G to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-roadmap-for-effective-education-videos-making-a-mark-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, The Roadmap for Effective Education Videos - Making a Mark on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/ultimate-lineup-for-gaming-on-the-go-leading-steam-decks-and-rog-docking-stations-in-202cued-by-your-request-i-have-created-two-seo-friendly-titles-that-con38/"><u>Ultimate Lineup for Gaming on the Go: Leading Steam Decks & ROG Docking Stations in 202Cued by Your Request, I Have Created Two SEO-Friendly Titles that Convey Similar Meanings to The Best Steam Deck and ROG Ally Docks of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unlock-free-fun-your-guide-to-checking-out-video-games-from-public-libraries/"><u>Unlock Free Fun: Your Guide to Checking Out Video Games From Public Libraries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unlocking-full-potential-the-benefits-of-equipping-every-controller-with-custom-thumbstick-covers/"><u>Unlocking Full Potential: The Benefits of Equipping Every Controller with Custom Thumbstick Covers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unlocking-game-enjoyment-essential-accessibility-options-for-all-gamers/"><u>Unlocking Game Enjoyment: Essential Accessibility Options for All Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unlocking-insights-how-to-tell-if-your-gmail-is-being-read/"><u>Unlocking Insights: How to Tell if Your Gmail Is Being Read</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

As much as I love my gaming laptops, both of my models, an Eluktronics and an MSI, both feel like they’re about to catch fire whenever I’m playing a heavy-hitting game like Division or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/destiny-2-4158011" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A couple gaming sessions later, and I realized I needed a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >laptop cooling pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After taking a look at various models, I decided to try out the HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad. It boasts five fans and an adjustable rollout switch to customize my cooling experience. And it offers anti-slip baffles so my curious cat can’t knock it off my laptop. After over a year of use, I still use this almost every day for my gaming needs. Read on for our final verdict, as well as thoughts on its specs.</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad"></a>Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad</h2><p> HAVIT offers this laptop cooling pad in two different colors: red and blue. I personally felt that the red would be too bright and opted for the blue; when I pulled it out of the box, I was surprised at how heavy its 1.8 pounds felt in my hand.</p><p> On top of the pad itself, it comes with a braided USB cord for protection. It could plug into one of two ports, of which I used the spare to add USB charging for USB compatible items like my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-kindle-2019-review-4688850" >Amazon Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286" >Java Bluetooth headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J6RTKS-ZdzNqPyF_Tm9lloOF1iM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_04-5a7071fefb884ba19eb68638fdbf1b2b.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust. If you’re looking for a simple design, this is not your cooling pad. That being said, the metal mesh pad for air circulation can accommodate laptops ranging from 14 to 17 inches thanks to its 15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 inches (LWH) in dimension.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away"><a href="#Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away" class="headerlink" title="Fans: Wasn’t blown away"></a>Fans: Wasn’t blown away</h2><p> I set up the cooling pad and flipped on the roller switch. HAVIT promises five quiet fans—one 110-millimeter fan, and four other strategically placed 85-millimeter fans. HAVIT holds true to its promise: This cooling pad emits a fairly faint sound I can’t hear through my Samsung Buds headphones, even with their noise cancelling features. The fans are so quiet that if I was gaming, I wasn’t able to hear them.</p><p> Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees.</p><p> Better yet, I could adjust the fans to customize how much air I wanted to circulate due to the roller switch HAVIT put as the on&#x2F;off switch. If I wasn’t sure about how much power I was putting into the fans, I could simply lift my laptop up from the pad; as I turned up the power, the blue LED lights in the cooling pad grew brighter.</p><p> Before getting this cooling pad, my Eluktronics laptop sounded like an airplane was taking off and landing at my desk space. I wish I could say that this changed after implementing the pad into my gaming rig, or even with my MSI laptop. Unfortunately, my laptops’ fans still sound like I’m on the tarmac instead of being at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/l2nDOOm1dGSmniJBqJPn708DnK8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_03-71babed64c14425184604e4825680aac.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> That’s not to say that this laptop cooling pad doesn’t help cool it down. Since my Eluktronics is getting some much-needed TLC in the shop, I tested the MSI’s internal temps while running<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tropico-6-review-5077604" >Tropico Six <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my laptop. Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a difference.</p><h2 id="Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing"><a href="#Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing" class="headerlink" title="Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing"></a>Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing</h2><p> If you feel the laptop needs more circulation, the good news is that HAVIT also anticipated these needs, too. Anti-slip baffles offer a sturdy position on any desk, even if you push up the height to a more angled position.</p><p> There is a sturdy flap should you prefer the angled laptop pad, or if you prefer, a sturdier laptop placement while flat. I tested out the height adjustment for a little while, but ultimately decided against using them for personal preference instead of durability reasons.</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXjExslBR5KBA1RSMPFlkkvF1uQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_02-f065f40118184391b6f1ba1bffa763bd.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> And, if you’re on-the-go and travelling, the HAVIT 5 also packs quite nicely into a suitcase. Be sure to play it safe like I did and pack it around clothes. But if you need to go across country and want to take your gaming laptop with you, this is a good one that will hold up well in luggage.</p><h2 id="Price-Ouch"><a href="#Price-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ouch"></a>Price: Ouch</h2><p> I picked up my HAVIT 5 while it was on sale for around $30 back in 2019, but the usual price is around $50. That seems a little steep, especially for fans that don’t necessarily pack the punch for gaming that most laptops require. If you keep an eye on Amazon, you can usually get this one for around $30, as it seems to go on sale fairly often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lItC7F6Ja8RbBfTaNXh5l9ufFqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_05-07577b69f7d04de5a7904e798681ba02-6b3615a38d584594b89077eaf51228b2.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> It makes sense to compare the Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad to the HAVIT. Both have five cooling fans, both fit laptops up to 17 inches, and both offer anti-slip baffles to ensure your laptop is safe if you want to adjust the height for more air circulation or wrist angle preferences. The key differences are design and adjustability.</p><p> While the HAVIT is clearly a gaming laptop cooling pad, the Kootak features smooth edges and has a more universal aesthetic to its design. The Kootak is also cheaper, at around $37. If you prefer a true gaming cooling pad, go with the HAVIT. If you don’t care about aesthetics and prefer to be cost conscious, the Kootak will be better suited to your needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good, but could be great.</strong></p><p> It’s not the best out there, but so long as it cools the internal laptop core temperatures by about 20 degrees, it’s a worthy investment. Props go to HAVIT for giving it a roller switch for ultimate adjustability and an LED light that will show how high the fans are blowing. The fans could be stronger, but quieter fans over more power is preferable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/urban-armor-gear-macbook-pro-case-review-4689954" >Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  5 Fan Laptop Cooler</li><li>Product Brand  HAVIT</li><li>MPN  HV-F2068</li><li>Price  $50.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2017</li><li>Weight  1.8 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Voltage  5V</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Connectivity Options  USB port (one cord included)</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-channel-roundup-students-best-picks-for-historical-insights-online/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Channel Roundup Students' Best Picks for Historical Insights Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-expert-picks-top-6-fb-lite-extractors/"><u>[New] Expert Picks Top 6 FB Lite Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/xploring-the-legal-aspects-of-youtube-content-capture-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring the Legal Aspects of YouTube Content Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-instant-social-interaction-tweetplusfb-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Instant Social Interaction Tweet+FB Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-strategies-for-perfecting-igtv-video-titles/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Strategies for Perfecting IGTV Video Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/easily-transform-videos-into-m4a-format-a-simple-guide/"><u>Easily Transform Videos Into M4A Format: A Simple Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-oem-unlock-missing-on-itel-p55-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Itel P55?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-samsung-galaxy-s24-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Samsung Galaxy S24 to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/m06-headphones-review-unmatched-bluetooth-performance/"><u>M06 Headphones Review: Unmatched Bluetooth Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/primetracking-smart-tracker-the-discreet-yet-powerful-choice-intruder-deterrent-review/"><u>PrimeTracking Smart Tracker: The Discreet Yet Powerful Choice -

Here’s What You Should Be Aware Of"></a>In the Market for a New Graphics Card in 2024? Here’s What You Should Be Aware Of</h2><p> The current <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-vivo-s17-pro-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> market is quite healthy and has several great options. The decision between getting an NVIDIA or AMD GPU boils down to how much you value ray tracing performance and whether you plan to use upscaling to improve performance.</p><p> If we disregard <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-openvidview-a-2024-innovation-no-price-tag/" >ray tracing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, AMD graphics cards do a good job of matching NVIDIA offerings at slightly lower price points. For example, the $550 AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE is just ahead of the $600 NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super, and the $500 AMD RX 7800 XT is about 10% slower than both. Then we have the $260 AMD RX 7600 that perfectly matches the rasterization performance—gaming performance without ray tracing effects—of the $300 NVIDIA RTX 4060. Basically, if we’re only looking at rasterization performance, AMD cards offer slightly better performance per dollar than their NVIDIA counterparts.</p><p> However, this is only half of the story. If we include ray tracing and <a class="link"   href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/add-music-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/" >DLSS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, NVIDIA GPUs are usually a better deal than their AMD counterparts. That said, <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-update-iphone-xs-max-to-the-latest-iosipados-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/" >FSR 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can match the visual quality of DLSS 3 at 4K; at 1440p DLSS <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capture-master-high-res-screen-record/" >looks better in most scenarios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, while at 1080p, DLSS is a clear winner. Then we have <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comprehensive-tips-for-monitoring-subscriber-engagement/" >DLSS 3 frame generation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a noticeably better option than FSR 3. In other words, if you plan on using upscaling to get as high performance in games as possible, NVIDIA looks like a better choice, especially if you want to play games with full ray tracing effects.</p><p> AMD, on the other hand, is a solid choice if you aren’t interested in ray tracing and don’t plan on using upscaling. It’s also worth noting that, in some situations, AMD cards can be a superior option because they usually offer more <a class="link"   href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-methods-for-rolling-macos-sierra-back-to-el-capitan/" >video memory <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than similarly priced NVIDIA GPUs. This can be important at higher resolutions.</p><p> NVIDIA’s budget and mid-range offerings have less memory than their AMD equivalents, which can thwart their gaming performance <a class="link"   href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2815-vram-4gb-vs-8gb/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20having%20enough%20VRAM%20on,faster%20than%20the%204GB%20version." >in some situations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For example, I can say from personal experience—I own an RTX 3070 that packs 8 gigs of vRAM—that 8GB of memory is not enough to play the latest AAA games with max textures at 1080p, let alone with ray tracing. <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> and <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> can use more than 8GB of memory when you crank up textures and other effects to the maximum; the same is true for <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, which I cannot play with ultra textures because the game starts to stutter after half an hour or so despite it working great before then.</p><p> Other things you should be aware of include the fact that NVIDIA GPUs use much less power to achieve the same level of performance as their AMD equivalents, they’re better at AI workloads, and are also a better choice for users who need a GPU for both gaming and work (such as video editing). Also, don’t forget to pair your new GPU with a CPU that can keep pace with it—you don’t want to create a <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-windows-11-what-to-do-if-your-system-fails-to-shut-down/" >CPU bottleneck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Finally, ensure your <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/youtubes-buzzing-titles-roundup-1-8/" >power supply <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is up to snuff before installing your new graphics card.</p><p> Now, let’s talk about the best GPUs.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>7</td><td>27</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

On top of all that, the card’s gorgeous thanks to its minimalist industrial design. On the other hand, the $1,150 price tag is quite high, and the card can use 320W under maximum load, meaning you’ll need a powerful PSU—700W or higher—to run without issues. You’ll also need a powerful CPU if you’re gaming at resolutions below 4K to avoid creating a CPU bottleneck.</p><p> If you want an RTX 4080 Super model that sells at the $1,000 mark, check out the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-GeForce-VertoTM-Overclocked-Graphics/dp/B0CS6XC69Y?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003007&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-graphics-cards/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >PNY GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16GB Verto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is just as powerful as other RTX 4080 Super models while offering the same level of cooling performance. The issue here is that there are multiple reports from owners about issues with the card’s fan controller, which usually resulted in having to return their cards and get replacements.</p><p> Finally, if you’re looking for the best of the best and don’t care about the price, get an RTX 4090.

The reference AMD card is noticeably slower due to its poor cooling solution, which leads to <a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/leading-titles-to-unlock-on-google-play-pass-a-ranking-of-the-8-greatest-games/">thermal throttling</a>.</p><p> The gaming performance on offer is enough for a high-refresh-rate gaming experience at 1440p, even in newer AAA titles. You’ll have to use FSR to go over 100fps in some situations, but you won’t have to use image upscaling if all you want is gaming performance that’s at or slightly above 60fps, even with all visual options cranked to the max. You can achieve 60fps with ray tracing in most games, but for that, you’ll need to activate FSR upscaling.</p><p> Thanks to its impressive performance and 16GB of memory, the RX 7900 GRE is also a solid choice for 4K gaming, as long as you’re ready to turn on FSR or drop some settings down from ultra to high. But since FSR can get close to the visual quality of DLSS in many games at 4K, this shouldn’t be a major issue.</p><p> The model listed here, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-11325-04-20G-Radeon-Gaming-Graphics/dp/B0CVR6WKM4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003007&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-graphics-cards/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >SAPPHIRE Pulse Radeon RX 7900 GRE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is a fantastic variant that sells at $549.99 MSRP and offers about 10% higher performance than AMD’s reference design. The card’s whisper quiet and has pretty solid thermals that are a bit higher than on more expensive models, but still nothing to worry about.</p><p> If you want something faster from AMD, the RX 7900 XT offers about 20% more frames for a 30% higher price.

Overall, this is a pretty solid little graphics card with enough oomph for 1080p gaming, even with some ray-tracing effects in some titles. If you want to game with this card at 1440p, you can get playable frame rates if you’re ready to drop textures to high or medium in newer AAA titles and use DLSS—but if that’s a deal breaker, you may need to look elsewhere.</p><p> On the other hand, for eSports-focused gamers, the RTX 4060 is an excellent choice, even at the 1440p resolution. I love that the card uses only 115W of power, meaning that most available models feature compact, dual-fan setups with even some low-profile designs that are perfect for ultra-compact gaming PCs. The main point of contention here is only 8GB of memory. These days, 8 gigs aren’t enough for high-end gaming, even at 1080p.</p><p> The model I recommend is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-WINDFORCE-GV-N4060GAMING-OC-8GD/dp/B0C8KQRH32?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003007&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-graphics-cards/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4060 GAMING OC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This isn’t the most compact RTX 4060 out there, but thanks to its three-fan cooling solution, you’ll most likely never hear the card, even while gaming. The best is the fact that the extra fan didn’t make the card more expensive, since this GPU is selling at only $10 over the MSRP.</p><p> If you want something more compact, get the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-DisplayPort-Axial-tech-Technology-Auto-Extreme/dp/B0C7YPGFFW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003007&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-graphics-cards/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4060 OC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which packs a surprisingly potent dual-fan cooling solution that stays quiet under heavy loads and costs the same as the GIGABYTE model.

For your money, you’re getting one of the best custom RX 7600 models that’s compact and quiet without being too warm.

This is NVIDIA’s best offering this generation, and I recommend it to gamers who want a high-end gaming experience with ray tracing but aren’t ready to spend half a month’s rent on a graphics card.</p><p> At $600, the RTX 4070 Super is a bit pricier than similar upper mid-range offerings of the past, but you’re still getting a lot for the money. The performance is excellent, with enough horsepower for a high refresh rate gaming experience in most titles, even the latest and greatest AAA games if you turn on DLSS. Then you have DLSS 3 frame generation that can push the frames to playable levels in AAA games with RT effects turned on.</p><p> Lastly, 12GB of video memory isn’t that much but is just right for a no-compromise gaming experience at 1440p. The card can also give a more than decent 4K gaming experience, as long as you’re ready to drop some intensive effects, turn down textures from ultra to high, and disable ray tracing in more graphically intensive titles.</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQPYSF1V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003007&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-graphics-cards/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4070 Super OC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> listed here is a dual-fan model, but that heatsink is more capable than what you might think at first glance.

You can find more ways to check which GPU you have in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/resolve-your-iphones-or-ipads-predictive-emoji-glitches-top-7-quick-fixes/" >how to check what graphics card is in your PC. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h3 id="How-do-I-check-to-see-if-my-GPU-can-fit-in-my-PC"><a href="#How-do-I-check-to-see-if-my-GPU-can-fit-in-my-PC" class="headerlink" title="How do I check to see if my GPU can fit in my PC?"></a>How do I check to see if my GPU can fit in my PC?</h3><p> To check whether your GPU can fit inside your PC, you need to find the graphics card clearance information for your PC case—usually listed on the webpage of your PC case under “specifications,” “GPU clearance,” or “GFX clearance”—and compare the info with the length of the graphics card you plan on buying.</p><p> If you own a micro ATX or mini ITX enclosure, you also have to check the width of the graphics card you’re eyeing—sometimes listed in slots, where a single slot is equal to 20mm—and compare it with the GPU clearance of your case. For example, one of the most popular ITX cases around, the Cooler Master NR200, has a GPU width clearance of 60mm, meaning it can house up to a triple slot graphics card. </p><h3 id="Are-all-graphics-cards-compatible-with-all-motherboards"><a href="#Are-all-graphics-cards-compatible-with-all-motherboards" class="headerlink" title="Are all graphics cards compatible with all motherboards?"></a>Are all graphics cards compatible with all motherboards?</h3><p> Generally, yes, with some exceptions. For example, many single board computers don’t feature a PCIe x16 slot, so you either can’t fit a graphics card on them, or have to get a PCIe adapter. But in general, if the motherboard in question has a x16 PCIe slot, you should be fine. </p><h3 id="Can-I-use-a-NVIDIA-GPU-with-an-AMD-CPU"><a href="#Can-I-use-a-NVIDIA-GPU-with-an-AMD-CPU" class="headerlink" title="Can I use a NVIDIA GPU with an AMD CPU?"></a>Can I use a NVIDIA GPU with an AMD CPU?</h3><p> Of course, you can use an NVIDIA GPU with an AMD CPU without issues.
