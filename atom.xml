It has all the charm you’d expect from a Nintendo console. It takes seconds to start up, its menu system is easy to figure out, and its game catalog is fantastic.</p><p> It’s starting to show its age with slower performance on some games but it’s worth the longer loading times.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>OLED screen looks fantastic</li><li>Extensive catalog of exclusive games</li><li>Can connect it to TV</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hardware is starting to show its age</li><li>No performance updates beyond the display</li></ul><p> Nothing about the Nintendo Switch OLED is clunky. The only ads you’ll see are for Nintendo services, so it’s very family-friendly. Game options include all your childhood favorites, including plenty of new versions of Mario, like Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Wonder, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the Legend of Zelda franchise.</p><p> There’s some comfort here, but the Nintendo Switch OLED still has room for more adult games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-nintendo-switch-controller-5218934" >leave games in sleep mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you can quickly resume where you left off, which is useful if you need to pause while traveling.</p><p> Back home, you can plug the console into your TV via the included dock to gather around as a family to play multiplayer games or enjoy a single-player session on a bigger screen. This feels less essential solo than with previous Switches, as the OLED screen looks great, but it’s nice to have the option.</p><p> Online play requires<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a paid service that offers emulated versions of old favorites from past consoles.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Wired, T3, Tom’s Guide, Digital Trends, and CNET recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> 90% of buyers on Amazon have rated the Nintendo Switch OLED five stars, with the console having an average score of 4.8 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >Valve Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0UYqsaz73PWhH6z5ksLDbIhSU-w=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SteamDeckOLED2-3ea64c8ac24943b5b4eb2e57f9ffe6f7.jpg" >Steam Deck OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >$450 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/2237665775" >$459 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" >$399 at Steampowered.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Steam Deck makes PC gaming truly portable and much simpler than ever before. It’s all within a sleek and easy to hold shell with a great screen whether you go LED or OLED. As with the Switch, you can always dock it, and even install Windows if you want a full portable PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC. Designed like a Nintendo Switch, it provides easy access to your Steam library thanks to running SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p> While you might be thinking, a gaming laptop does all that, the Steam Deck is far more portable than any gaming laptop.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Huge range of games via Steam</li><li>More accessible PC gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Battery life can be poor</li><li>Customization can get very complicated</li></ul><p> Because the Steam Deck is built like a Nintendo Switch, it feels very portable. Its either 7-inch LCD or 7.4-inch OLED screen ensures you can see plenty of what’s going on without the bulk of a 14- —to 17-inch laptop screen.</p><p> Due to its size, it won’t play games at the highest detail level but it still looks good and aligns well with the screen size involved. You can always dock it with your TV, like the Nintendo Switch, if you prefer.</p><p> Regular PC gamers like me will already have extensive Steam libraries to explore, and there are often sales on the Steam store, meaning the Steam Deck can provide good value over time.</p><p> Not every game on the store is compatible with the Steam Deck, but the number is growing rapidly.</p><p> Technically minded people can also spend time customizing the device, either installing Windows to extend their options or other game launchers like Battle.net or the Epic Games Store Launcher. It’s fun to tinker with.</p><p> Battery life could be better, but the Steam Deck truly is a PC in your hands, so that’s to be expected. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, and I’ve enjoyed catching up with my Steam library in a couch-friendly format.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Verge, Forbes, IGN, PCGamer, and Wired have all recommended the Steam Deck with the Steam Deck OLED considered a particular highlight.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Steam Deck has sold over 3 million units on the Steam website. Relatively recently featured on Amazon, it has 86% four- or five-star ratings across 564 reviews.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/B5s9keNJcOmzNUWzyuCLkCGE1fc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HyperMegaTechSuperPocket1-e0c2f7f305d143ad9cf64143fbe17afd.jpg" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >$60 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-hyper-mega-tech-taito-super-pocket-green-black/6549862.p?skuId=6549862" >$56 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Old enough to remember the Nintendo Game Boy?

It’s easily the sturdiest flash drive we’ve evaluated.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> Topping our list of USB flash drives is the SanDisk Extreme PRO. Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this.

Oh, and its 1TB storage capacity is impressive too.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> Resembling a mini flashlight, the Flash Survivor Stealth USB roars with a behemoth 1TB storage capacity. To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We also appreciate how the Flash Survivor Stealth USB opens. Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution.

Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-ace-tools-review-6-superior-options-for-photo-backdrop-cleanup/"><u>[New] Ace Tools Review -

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Design: Vanilla**<p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.

In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal.

Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested. If you can get the performance you need from the 1byone, it’s the antenna to buy. I wouldn’t consider other options unless you’ve already ruled out this one.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplified Digital

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/days-gone-gameplay-analysis-by-a-road-warrior-battling-undead-in-the-wild-west-of-apocalypse/"><u>'Days Gone' Gameplay Analysis by a Road Warrior: Battling Undead in the Wild West of Apocalypse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-shifting-paradigms-non-youtube-video-hosts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Shifting Paradigms  Non-Youtube Video Hosts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlinedwebcamtechniqueinstruction/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  StreamlinedWebCamTechniqueInstruction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-digital-dive-capturing-the-days-lifelike-snapshots-on-fb/"><u>[New] In 2024, Digital Dive  Capturing the Day's Lifelike Snapshots on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-the-art-of-capturing-spoken-words-digitally/"><u>[New] Perfecting the Art of Capturing Spoken Words Digitally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-curating-youtube-music-experiences-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Curating YouTube Music Experiences for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-best-student-friendly-history-vid-hubs-1-10/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Student-Friendly History Vid Hubs (#1-10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tracing-the-exits-who-left-my-insta-feed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tracing the Exits  Who Left My Insta Feed?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-tecno-spark-20c-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Tecno Spark 20C Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-honor-magic5-ultimate-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Honor Magic5 Ultimate?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you have a growing family or a growing list of devices competing for bandwidth in your home, you’ve probably experienced jockeying for a signal here or there. That’s where a capable tri-band router like the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router comes in handy. This router boasts high-speed Wi-Fi of up to 3.2Gbps and three different Wi-Fi bands that work simultaneously to deliver the connectivity all your family members and devices require.</p><p> We used this tri-band router and observed various aspects starting with the setup process, software ease of use, and performance power when performing typical streaming and browsing activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q6eQHVPL_nzfI20_HhRY5seg85c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-3-3baf530c5df54c9c903579053d19c25c.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-little-flashy"><a href="#Design-A-little-flashy" class="headerlink" title="Design: A little flashy"></a><strong>Design: A little flashy</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 router is aptly named for its six antennas that are fixed to both sides of the face of the device. While you can easily fold these antennas flat, for easy moving to and from one spot to another, you’ll need to place them upright in order to maximize the signal strength.</p><p> Aside from the unique antenna design, all the indicator lights are also presented in a sort of stylish way right down the middle of the router. All the lights flash white and the Wi-Fi on&#x2F;off and WPS buttons are set off on their own at the bottom with triangular buttons. The main body of the router is box-like in shape and skews larger with dimensions of 11.63 x 8.92 x 2.14 inches (HWD). Some shoppers may like the aeronautic design of the router, inspired by the Nighthawk stealth fighter plane, which also looks somewhat futuristic. If you’re looking for a router that’s unassuming, you won’t find that here.</p><p> All the ports are easy to locate at the back of the device. These include four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one WAN port, and one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and one USB 2.0 port. You’ll also find the power button and DC power input in the same row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GsN851fjmzxtWs6ShQfaWQtEPok=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-2-b6366698f8d14745a5027973d8657745.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road</strong></h2><p> Unboxing the Nighthawk X6 R8000, we were reminded several times to download the companion Nighthawk<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete the setup process. There is a sticker on top of the router with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the app can use to detect the router and launches a quick setup process, but we couldn’t get this code to register. Instead, we went to the App Store and manually downloaded the mobile app.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices.</p><p> The first thing we had to do when we launched the Nighthawk app was to create a Netgear account. Then we chose the “New Setup” option and were directed to reboot our modem and then attach the provided Ethernet cable into the router and our modem. Almost instantly we were able to connect to the default network using the credentials the manufacturer provided. We returned to the app to set up another line of defense to the router admin login credentials with security questions and customize our system network and password.</p><p> After these changes, we had to reconnect to the network which went off without a hitch. We further chose to apply the firmware update that was recommended. That took several minutes and also required rebooting the router. At this point, we noticed that the second 5GHz connection was lost. After several attempts to make things right by resetting the router and the modem and router, the only step that resolved it was a factory reset. We suspect this could have been an issue with the firmware update, but once all of that was finally resolved we were able to connect to our 150Mbps Xfinity service on all three bands.</p><p> Overall, minus the hitch that tacked on an additional 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, we found the guided setup to be straightforward, quick, and easy to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHfwPJF-cpnSAITo_i4moZ2Jnw0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-4-1d3586d798cf44a9b219c9fd885069b3.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology"><a href="#Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology"></a><strong>Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology</strong></h2><p> This is an 802.11ac tri-band router, meaning it supports three frequencies: one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz channels on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/802-11ac-in-wireless-networking-818284" >802.11ac wireless standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The advantage here is that unlike older single- or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that operate on older Wi-Fi standards or even newer dual-band options functioning on the most current Wi-Fi 5 standard, there’s additional support for more devices and less competition over bandwidth.</p><p> That’s supported by beamforming technology, which is a feature all 802.11ac routers support. This technology sends targeted Wi-Fi signals to your devices rather than sending them in every direction. Ultimately, this means a stronger direct signal to your laptop, TV, or other devices, and potentially more consistent and stronger connections.</p><p> Since this router is classified as an AC3200 device, that means it has the potential to deliver up to 600Mbps (megabit per second) on the 2.4GHz spectrum and up to 1300Mbps on the 5GHz channels. This Wi-Fi speed rating doesn’t guarantee you’ll see these exact results in your home. It’s merely a number that describes the absolute potential performance power. In reality, the speeds you see will depend on the type of internet service plan you have and other environmental and network conditions that impact wireless performance.</p><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 also comes with Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) technology, which is another tool for managing bandwidth by allocating signals in specific directions and based on your priorities. Netgear says that users who like to game and stream video (and have combined download and upload speeds of less than 300Mbps) could garner enhanced performance by enabling this feature, which you can do from the web interface—but not the app.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming</strong></h2><p> Using the Nighthawk app’s built-in speed test feature, which uses the Ookla SpeedTest technology, the best download speed registered at 95Mbps right after we set up the router. More typically, the output was around 88-95Mbps at varying points in the day.</p><p> We could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands.</p><p> We never experienced a completely dropped connection, but at times the 2.4GHz channel performed sluggishly with simple operations like checking email or online browsing. We connected TVs where we stream HD and 4K content and use a gaming console to the 5GHz networks and used the 2.4GHz channel for laptops, mobile devices, and a tablet. Distributing those devices across the other two bands seemed to ease some congestion, and we could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands. We also noticed a mild improvement in image clarity and loading speed of streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.</p><p> Though we were unable to test the full range of this router, we had no issues in our 1,100-square-foot space. The manufacturer does say that this device can serve very large homes and there are six antennas that help boost this coverage, but the actual range—just like speed—will depend on factors like the thickness of your walls, router placement, and interference from other signals and devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qDgf4s6CZg8XEea_CVo6DMwg5lg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-5-733eda7f890a4105b5bc94ddf8169c81.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly and intuitive"></a><strong>Software: User-friendly and intuitive</strong></h2><p> Everything is laid out quite cleanly in the Nighthawk app in terms of guided setup and accessing the information most users will probably be interested in—like speed information, devices connected, Wi-Fi settings, and parental controls using the Circle with Disney app to monitor everyone’s screen time and activity. The app also comes with a 30-day trial of Netgear Armor security, which does the work of detecting threats from malware, bots, and any other network vulnerabilities.</p><p> The mobile app certainly skews more toward the general user with its uncomplicated layout, but that also means less control over more technical specifications which requires using the web interface. This information isn’t necessarily hidden, but it’s only laid out in the user manual which is accessible from the Netgear site.</p><p> This router is equally friendly to the general user as well as the more tech-savvy customer.</p><p> While the Nighthawk X6 does come with built-in firewall protection, you can elevate security settings and personalize the router setup from the router’s web interface. From the web GUI’s advanced settings area, you can control access or block certain websites, set up security email notifications, establish VPN service, create a personal FTP server, or use<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-dynamic-dns-816294" >Dynamic DNS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Other features of interest through the web GUI include setting up a USB device to perform Time Machine backups for Mac laptops and using the router’s media server capabilities to play music from the iTunes server.</p><p> In this respect, the Nighthawk X6 R8000 is equally friendly to the general user who doesn’t want to delve into the technical deep end as well as the more tech-savvy customer who does.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Price: A bit steep**<p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 has a list price of $270, which certainly places it in the high-end tier of wireless routers. And while it’s not the most expensive tri-band router on the market, your decision to make this investment could come down to factors like how large your home is, how many devices you’re working with, and how fast your internet service plan is. The tri-band Wi-Fi technology is impressive, and there are many attractive features: an intuitive and low-effort app, built-in security with Netgear Armor, as well as a detailed level of control over managing how everyone in the family spends their screen time, but there are equally capable as less expensive options on the market.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200</strong></h2><p> One of the strengths of the Nighthawk X6 R800 is how fast and simple it is to set up for even those who are tech-shy. But if you’re willing or interested in diving in deeper technically, paying less, and still obtaining impressive Wi-Fi performance, the Asus RT-AC3200 retails for $200 and overlaps with the Nighthawk X6 in a number of ways. Both feature three bands, six antennas, QoS and beamforming technologies, VPN and Time Machine support, and peace of mind with respective built-in security platforms.</p><p> The Asus router does require a little more technical know-how for managing the router via the app and web interface. Another factor that may influence whether you think this trade-off is worth it is your interest in integrating your router into a smart-home configuration. The Nighthawk X6 R8000, like many other<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-netgear-routers-4159862" >Netgear routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does allow that with Amazon Alexa compatibility whereas the Asus RT-AC3200 does not.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An investment that could be worth it for the family with a smart home.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices. If you’re interested in spending less time with configuration and more time benefiting from the assurance that your network is protected, the Nighthawk X6 can fulfill those wants. You can also easily bring this device into the fold of your smart-home setup and keep a close eye on the online safety and activity of everyone in the family.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router (R8000)</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>MPN  R8000</li><li>Price  $269.99</li><li>Weight  2.43 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.63 x 8 x 2.14 in.</li><li>Compatibility  Amazon Echo&#x2F;Alexa</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antenna  6</li><li>Number of Bands  3</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  7</li><li>Chipset  BCM4709AO</li><li>Range  Very large homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-cutting-the-clutter-eschewing-fb-video-ads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting the Clutter  Eschewing FB Video Ads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-efficiently-speaking-out-a-blueprint-for-reporting-incidents-in-digital-communities/"><u>[New] Efficiently Speaking Out  A Blueprint for Reporting Incidents in Digital Communities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-elevating-youtube-productions-with-effective-video-lighting-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevating YouTube Productions with Effective Video Lighting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-instagram-qanda-beyond-basic-usage/"><u>[New] Instagram Q&A  Beyond Basic Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photographic-perfection-in-the-palm-of-your-hands-online/"><u>[New] Photographic Perfection in the Palm of Your Hands Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-quick-fixes-for-perfect-ipad-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>[New] Quick Fixes for Perfect iPad Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-30-webcams-built-for-windows-os/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Top 30 Webcams Built for Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-search-of-perfection-gopros-1-10-case-review-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] In Search of Perfection - GoPro's #1-10 Case Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-securely-and-swiftly-acquiring-your-youtube-watch-lists/"><u>[Updated] Securely and Swiftly Acquiring Your YouTube Watch Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-buyers-guide-to-the-supreme-game-console-innovations-of-2024/"><u>A Buyer's Guide to the Supreme Game Console Innovations of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-microsofts-latest-tablet-the-refreshed-surface-pro-7s-solid-performance-retained/"><u>A Comprehensive Review of Microsoft's Latest Tablet: The Refreshed Surface Pro 7'S Solid Performance Retained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/affordable-reading-joy-in-depth-look-at-the-2019-basic-amazon-kindle-model/"><u>Affordable Reading Joy: In-Depth Look at The 2019 Basic Amazon Kindle Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/apple-ipad-air-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7plus-two-premium-tablets-without-compromise/"><u>Apple iPad Air 4 Vs.

available only for some games</li></ul><p> Razer’s Goliathus 36.2 x 11.6-inch gaming mat has a thin border of customizable RGB lighting to surround your keyboard and mouse. It uses Razer Chroma software and includes a dizzying number of colors—16.8 million, to be exact, plus tons of animated effects—so you can set it to match your rig perfectly. Gamers can even synchronize it with a select list of games and apps to provide immersive, responsive lighting effects along with the action.</p><p> The pad’s surface is covered in micro-textured cloth to allow for precise tracking, no matter what mouse you use. The underside has a layer of grippy rubber to prevent sliding, so everything stays where it’s supposed to.</p><p> Razer also sells mice and keyboards with Chroma software if you want to make your setup even more coordinated.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.22 x 11.57 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Micro-textured cloth |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : RGB |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Non-slip rubber base, light synchronization</p><h2 id="Runner-Up"><a href="#Runner-Up" class="headerlink" title="Runner-Up"></a>Runner-Up</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >SteelSeries QcK Prism XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fdLUdGA45Aj8YOxbW0ZCudg8s24=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/steelseries-qck-prism-xl-gaming-surface-6e9ae015effe48c8ab63fe896fcb1067.jpg" >SteelSeries QcK Prism XL Gaming Surface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Best buy</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/553015550" >$87 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6285961.p" >$60 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/Keyboards-&-Mice%255FMouse-Wrist-Pads/78277174?slfpid=3" >$60 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Two-zone RGB lighting</li><li>Works for low and high DPI settings</li><li>Good for gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not as wide as some other options</li></ul><p> The SteelSeries QcK Prism XL is our runner-up for best overall, but it was a very close call, given this mat has so many solid features at a reasonable price. While 35.4 x 11.8 inches is about an inch narrower than many other pads on our list, this mouse pad is still large enough to fit all your peripherals.</p><p> There are also different sizes if you like the mouse pad but want to go even bigger. All the pads have a micro-woven cloth top to ensure reasonable control in high and low DPI setups. Movement feels smooth and accurate as you play games.</p><p> Some people may find RGB distracting during games. Still, you can set up the two-zone RGB dynamic illumination to provide important in-game information, such as damage, ammo capacity, and more. One negative is that you will need other SteelSeries equipment to utilize PrismSync technology fully.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 35.4 x 11.8 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth top, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : Two-zone RGB |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : In-game lighting notifications</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nZU2Rn-oEYw6t99X5958tFrM0B8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/corsair-mm300-anti-fray-mouse-pad-a95d6e497072429fa82162c9b5b1d90c.jpg" >Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01798VS4C?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01798VS4C" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Corsair-Gaming-MM300-Anti-Fray-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse-Mat-Extended/52387677?slpfid=3" >$21 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/456522/Corsair-Gaming-MM300-Anti-Fray-Cloth/" >$39 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Optimized for high-DPI gaming mice</li><li>Option for thicker padding</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Strong rubber smell out of the box</li></ul><p> The Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad measures 36.6 x 11.8 inches and foregoes the ultra-sleek spaceship aesthetic for something more textured. The fabric top has a low-friction weave for precise tracking designed for high-DPI mice (laser and optical).</p><p> The surface has a pre-worn pattern, a little welcome grunge for people who aren’t necessarily about RGB. The edges of the mouse pad have heavy stitching to prevent fraying, and the base is a layer of non-slip rubber, so when you set it on your desk, it stays there.</p><p> These Corsair mouse pads also come in a “Thick” size, which puts 0.2 inches of squishy rubber between your mouse and desk. They’re an excellent option for anyone who wants to smooth over an uneven surface or wants extra cushioning while they game. The price for the number of different options and thickness makes this our pick for the best value.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 11.8 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Options for extra padding, spill-proof coating</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >Logitech G840 XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z8-UgXiK3ZjbS5LwJX44cYjMjSA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/logitech-g840-xl-gaming-mousepad-82ab39199d8345758a08234c411032d1.jpg" >Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XWW5KTT?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB09XWW5KTT" >$40 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mouse-pads/g840-cloth-xl-gaming-mouse-pad.943-000117.html" >$32 at Logitechg.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Moderate friction for mouse feedback</li><li>Includes carrying case</li><li>Neutral design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Surface attracts lint</li></ul><p> If you want something with a subtle design, the Logitech G840 XL mouse pad sports an all-black surface with just a hint of blue on the edges.

It even comes with a transport tube.</p><p> While some extra-large mouse pads advertise super low-friction surfaces, slipperiness can make mouse movements feel imprecise or more challenging to control for some gamers. The G840 XL offers moderate friction to give you more feedback on your mouse movements, and the cloth surface is tuned for superior tracking consistency.</p><p> Like several other mouse pads on this list, the G840 XL has a rubber backing that prevents slipping and sliding on your gaming surface.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 15.7 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth surface, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Transport tube</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Precision"><a href="#Best-for-Precision" class="headerlink" title="Best for Precision"></a>Best for Precision</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >ASUS ROG Sheath <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GoGTZn-b8hF20EDxs5zVEQhnxbA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-rog-sheath-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-538728f26a4b4202854815d0a5a17898.jpg" >ASUS ROG Sheath Extended Gaming Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5ATZAE/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB01G5ATZAE" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54023009" >$30 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.qvc.com/qvc.product.E352558.html?slfpid=3" >$40 at QVC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Low-profile stitched edges</li><li>Very durable surface</li><li>Larger size than most</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Tends to slide a bit</li></ul><p> This ROG Sheath mouse pad from ASUS is a bit larger than most of the options on this list, measuring 35.4 x 17.3 inches and about 0.12 inches thick, but it’s all about precision. The woven surface makes for precise mouse tracking and minimal friction. Even the stitched borders are as low-profile as possible to prevent that bumper car effect if your mouse gets too close to the edge. That stitching also guards against fraying.</p><p> The ROG Sheath has undergone lots of durability testing to ensure that the pad’s surface will hold up under repeated swipes of your mouse. It’s also temperature resistant (up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) to withstand even the hottest PC. The one downside is that this pad is lightweight enough to slide around a bit with a smooth desk surface. It has a rubber backing to cut down on this kind of movement.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 35.4 x 17.3 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth top, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Stitched edges</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Speed"><a href="#Best-for-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Best for Speed"></a>Best for Speed</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >HyperX Fury S Speed Edition XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jAXq76RQVfP3cnaSWNozlSy-5jk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hyperx-fury-s-speed-edition-xl-ac4077d3e54741479b238c547caf645d.jpg" >HyperX Fury S Speed Edition XL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HyperX-4P5Q8AA-Fury-S-XL-Gaming-Mouse-Pad/106007410?slfpid=3" >View on Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Anti-fray edges</li><li>Optimized for optical mouse tracking</li><li>Durable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Surface might be too slippery for some</li></ul><p> The Fury S mouse pad from HyperX is available in different sizes and color options.

We chose the Extended XL Spill-proof version for our selection of best for durability. The Corsair MM350 is a good size, measuring 36.6 x 15.7 inches, and has an ideal thickness of 0.15 inches, which is definitely on the thicker end for most mouse pads.</p><p> There are stitched edges that hold up to the movements of your arms and prevent the edges from fraying. However, over a long period of use, you may see some mild edge fraying, but you likely won’t see fraying on the actual mouse pad surface. The spill-proof and stain-resistant coating works well and will wipe clean easily.</p><p> The bottom has a rubber coating to prevent slipping, which works as it should, especially considering the heavier weight of the pad has to it. Overall, this mouse pad should last you for a long time and go through many gaming sessions.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 36.6 x 15.7 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Micro-weave cloth fabric |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Spill-proof and stain-resistant coating</p><h2 id="Best-Value"><a href="#Best-Value" class="headerlink" title="Best Value"></a>Best Value</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >Razer Gigantus v2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HQ3LX4yyYuicmc2i2Z7fURhMwIc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/razer-gigantus-v2-gaming-mouse-pad-efe4cdde2f914057b5107aa40e7d31a9.jpg" >Razer Gigantus v2 Gaming Mouse Pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885FJ8CB/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584491%7Cn0d0b5c1f21ec4cc9bd001edccd699cd621%7CB0885FJ8CB" >$27 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Razer-Gigantus-V2-Cloth-Gaming-Mouse-Pad-XXL-Thick-High-Density-Foam-Non-Slip-Base-Non-Slip-Base-Classic-Black/486130680?slfpid=3" >$27 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6417112.p" >$27 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Simple, clean design</li><li>Thick</li><li>Customizable through Razer website</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No stitched edge</li></ul><p> When purchasing a budget extended mouse pad, you want to feel like you’re getting the best quality possible for a lower price and not buying a cheap imitation. The Razer Gigantus V2 retails at $30 for the XXL version, but it still feels like Razer made it with great care and quality.</p><p> The Gigantus V2 measures 37 x 10.83 inches and has a thickness of 0.15 inches, which feels comfortable under your arms. The textured micro-weave surface has the right balance between grip and slide for your mouse, ensuring accuracy, while the rubber anti-slip base holds everything in place.</p><p> The mouse pad has a simple black and green look, but the Razer website allows you to pick a design you like and add your Gamertag for fun. There is no stitched edging, so there is the possibility of fraying, but this is a well-made mouse pad that’s worth the money.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> : 37 x 10.83 inches |<strong>Material</strong> : Cloth top, rubber bottom |<strong>Lighting&#x2F;Ports</strong> : None |<strong>Additional Features</strong> : Customizable through website</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

You can also choose if you want low or moderate friction, impacting how much you feel the surface under your hand.</p><p> If you aren’t serious about these details, you can prioritize aesthetics and go with a pad matching your setup. Choose from bold graphics, subdued neutrals, and customizable lighting options to complete your gaming station.</p><h3 id="Dimensions"><a href="#Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Dimensions"></a>Dimensions</h3><p> Measure your desk space before upgrading from a regular mouse pad to one with extended dimensions. It should be able to fit under your keyboard with some room to spare and should provide plenty of space around your mouse to move freely.</p><p> Most of the mousepads on this list are among the largest offered by these brands—if they seem too big for your setup, check and see if the item is available in medium or large dimensions rather than extra-large.</p><h3 id="Surface-Friction"><a href="#Surface-Friction" class="headerlink" title="Surface Friction"></a>Surface Friction</h3><p> The amount of friction you want from your mouse pad depends mainly on your preferences and play style. Generally speaking, low-DPI gamers prefer moderate friction because it improves control and makes it easier to stop the mouse after fast bursts of movement. High-DPI gamers often prefer low friction because it allows precise movement and speed.</p><p> But there are no hard and fast rules. If you like to “feel” the gaming surface under your mouse, look for something slightly more texture. If you want to zip around on a super-smooth surface, check out low-friction mouse pads that prioritize speed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Durability"><a href="#Durability" class="headerlink" title="Durability"></a>Durability</h3><p> If you buy better quality, you’ll buy less often.

The pad prevents the mouse from being damaged by rubbing over your desk surface and also protects your desk from wear and tear from the mouse. Most mice today are either<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/whats-the-difference-between-optical-and-laser-mice-2640209" >optical or laser mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and their sensors can read mouse pad material better than other surfaces like wood or glass.</li><li>Are extended mouse pads worth it?<br> Absolutely. An extended mouse pad will prevent your mouse from running off the edge of your mouse pad when you’re excitedly playing a match, and it will also hold up to more wear than a standard mouse pad. These mousepads also provide excellent protection for your desk and are a great look for your gaming station.</li><li>What mouse pad do pro gamers use?<br> Many pro gamers are sponsored so that they will use a brand of mouse pad affiliated with their sponsorship. However, pro gamers may prefer extended mouse pads for comfort and performance. If you like a flash appearance, a mousepad with RGB lighting always lends a bit of style.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-breaking-boundaries-coordinated-video-watch-across-channels/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Breaking Boundaries  Coordinated Video Watch Across Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-beijings-frigid-triumph-in-winter-sports-2022/"><u>[New] Beijing's Frigid Triumph in Winter Sports, 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-strategic-screen-customization-timely-adjustments-in-teams/"><u>[New] In 2024, Strategic Screen Customization  Timely Adjustments in Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-perfect-snapchat-video-maximizing-mac-capabilities/"><u>[New] Perfect Snapchat Video  Maximizing Mac Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-securing-your-content-adobe-presenter-captures/"><u>[New] Securing Your Content  Adobe Presenter Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-your-pathway-to-successful-youtube-beginnings-techniques-1-and-2/"><u>[New] Your Pathway to Successful YouTube Beginnings (Techniques 1 & 2)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-clandestine-call-collectors-discreet-voice-capture-tools-list/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Clandestine Call Collectors  Discreet Voice Capture Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-array-manipulations-and-sorting-algorithms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Array Manipulations and Sorting Algorithms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-stepwise-approach-to-update-meet-username-laptopmobile/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Stepwise Approach to Update Meet Username (Laptop/Mobile)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-premier-video-converters-for-tweeting-videos/"><u>[Updated] Premier Video Converters for Tweeting Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-reviving-brands-through-customer-video-appeals/"><u>[Updated] Reviving Brands Through Customer Video Appeals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-skys-limit-broken-by-djis-pro-drone-review/"><u>[Updated] The Sky's Limit Broken by DJI’s Pro Drone Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-key-players-transforming-vr-landscape/"><u>2024 Approved  Key Players Transforming VR Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-obs-studio-and-skype-a-perfect-duo-explained/"><u>2024 Approved  OBS Studio & Skype  A Perfect Duo Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quick-fix-techniques-for-exceptional-instagram-collages/"><u>2024 Approved  Quick-Fix Techniques for Exceptional Instagram Collages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-thrilling-space-adventure-the-outer-worlds-video-game-an-engaging-sci-fi-action-experience/"><u>A Thrilling Space Adventure: The 'Outer Worlds' Video Game -

the test. Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Apple M1 iMac (2021) represents the first major update to the line since 2016. It’s forward-looking as the first iMac to sport<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-you-should-care-about-silicon-macs-5086037" >Apple silicon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> under the hood, but it also hearkens back to days gone by with a fanciful selection of color options.</p><p> This iteration of hardware has a bigger display, an upgraded microphone, speakers, and camera, and an optional TouchID-enabled Magic Keyboard, in addition to a number of other upgrades and design tweaks compared to the last Intel iMac.</p><p> Having already spent a lot of time with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >M1 MacBook Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mac-mini-m1-apple-review-5092828" >Mac mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Apple released in 2020, I was quite curious to see how similar hardware might be implemented in the iMac line. I chose the entry-level model for testing, decked out in a soothing two-tone metallic blue, cleared some desk space, and replaced my regular work rig for about a month.</p><p> Over the course of my month with the M1 iMac, I specifically tested things like network performance and gaming benchmarks, but I also used it for work, media, voice and video calls, and gaming. There were a few instances where I had to fall back to my Windows rig, specifically for unsupported games, but the M1 iMac handled just about every other task without issue.</p><h2 id="Design-Colors-are-back-and-they-look-better-than-ever"><a href="#Design-Colors-are-back-and-they-look-better-than-ever" class="headerlink" title="Design: Colors are back, and they look better than ever"></a>Design: Colors are back, and they look better than ever</h2><p> Apple could have taken the easy route and just swapped the M1 hardware into the existing iMac line, but the M1 iMac represents a total redesign from the ground up. The basic look is fairly similar, but the new design has cleaner lines, a uniformly thin body, thinner screen borders, and comes in a variety of attractive colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kWyk_ORWGF4cESW9qR4PB_fq-oU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iMacM12021_3-259902f12007403184368f631caabff7.jpg"                      alt="iMac M1 (2021)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The latter represents a bit of a return to form, as the iMac line was once known for its bright, friendly color options, but the last few iterations have been available only in shades of white, silver, and grey.</p><p> While the front of the new iMac looks fairly similar to the last version, with a thick bezel and big chin, the similarity fades when you view the machine side-on. Instead of a big bulge on the back to house the internals, the M1 iMac is flat like a tablet. The guts are all located in the chin, which is why it’s still so big.</p><p> Expect to invest in a USB-C hub if you don’t already have one.</p><p> The stand has also been re-envisioned, as it no longer flares out at the base. It actually looks a lot like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/these-apple-accessories-cost-more-than-they-should-5090051" >$999 Pro Stand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , although it has only a simple hinge to tilt the screen forward and back instead of allowing you to raise and lower it a bit as well. Even without the flare, it provides a rock-solid base.</p><p> The USB ports are located on the back of the M1 iMac on the left side. The base model is limited to two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-vs-thunderbolt-5073091" >USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , while the upgraded version adds two additional<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also a microphone jack located on the left side of the chassis, and some models include an Ethernet port built into the power supply. The base model I tested had only the two Thunderbolt ports and no Ethernet port.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UXQsm7-2bXrWZaRKJCYnriKsm2Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iMacM12021_5-6ad0711fc0d04f55b6f77624fb1479af.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac M1 (2021)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

The four Thunderbolt and USB-C ports found on the higher-end model aren’t enough, and the paltry two ports you get with the lower-end model definitely fall short. Expect to invest in a USB-C hub if you don’t already have one.</p><p> While the jump to Apple silicon is the biggest story here, Apple really hit the design out of the park as well. This is an all-in-one that looks great from every angle. It’s a shame it’s held back by a few small issues, like a baffling lack of ports, but that doesn’t stop it from looking great on your desk.</p><h2 id="Display-Beautiful-24-inch-retina-display"><a href="#Display-Beautiful-24-inch-retina-display" class="headerlink" title="Display: Beautiful 24-inch retina display"></a>Display: Beautiful 24-inch retina display</h2><p> Apple bumped the screen size from 21.5 inches to 24 inches for the M1 iMac refresh, and the difference is remarkable. Apple refers to the panel as a 4.5K<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-retina-display-2000362" >Retina display <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which translates to a resolution of 4480 x 2520 and a pixel density of 218ppi in terms of hard numbers.</p><p> Colors also look fantastic, as the display covers the entire<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-true-tone-display-4048131" >DCI-P3 gamut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s quite bright as well.

The version of the hardware I tested came with an 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU, but you can also get the 2021 iMac with an 8-core GPU if you need the extra performance.</p><p> Like other M1 Macs, the CPU here is split into four high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores. This means it’s more energy efficient than a lot of the competition, and single-core performance is remarkably strong, but multi-core performance is only middling.</p><p> To get a performance baseline that you can compare to other hardware, I ran a handful of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-benchmark-2625811" >benchmarks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . I started off with Cinebench, which has both single and multi-core tests. As expected, the M1 iMac performed exceptionally well in the single-core test and not as great in the multi-core test.</p><p> The M1 iMac scored 1492 in the single core Cinebench test, which is only a bit shy of the 1532 scored by an 11th gen Intel Core i7. In the multi-core test, it scored a lower 6893. These numbers are both a bit lower than I saw from the M1 Mac Mini, which put up a single core score of 1521 and a multi-core score of 7662.</p><p> After Cinebench, I loaded up GFXBench Metal to run a few gaming benchmarks. The first one I ran was Aztec Ruins (High Tier), which simulates a high end game with real-time lighting and other effects. In that benchmark, the M1 iMac managed to run at about 22 FPS. That’s less than ideal, but on the edge of being playable.</p><p> Next up, I ran the Car Case benchmark that simulates a high-speed racing type game. In that benchmark, the M1 iMac managed about 21 FPS. That’s a bit low, but I saw a better result when I ran the less-intense T-Rex benchmark. In that benchmark, the M1 iMac hit 60 FPS.</p><p> It’s important to note I tested the entry-level iMac that comes with a 7-core GPU. When I tested the M1 Mac mini with the 8-core GPU last year, it hit about 60 FPS in the Car Chase benchmark, so I expect that an iMac equipped with the 8-core GPU would turn in similar results.</p><p> While I had to go back to my Windows machine for most of my gaming due to a lack of compatibility, the iMac performed surprisingly well in the games I did play. I was particularly impressed with how well it ran<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-final-fantasy-4157832" >Final Fantasy 14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which doesn’t have a native M1 client. I was able to squeeze out 30 FPS with relatively high settings and main tank runs of both Tower at Paradigm’s Breach and Delubrum Reginae without incident.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Pro-users-may-want-to-hold-off-but-the-M1-iMac-is-ready-for-work"><a href="#Productivity-Pro-users-may-want-to-hold-off-but-the-M1-iMac-is-ready-for-work" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Pro users may want to hold off, but the M1 iMac is ready for work"></a>Productivity: Pro users may want to hold off, but the M1 iMac is ready for work</h2><p> Apple’s powerful M1 chip and a big 4.5K display combine to turn the 2021 iMac into a productivity powerhouse. I used it for my main work machine for about a month without incident, primarily for word processing, image editing, and other productivity tasks. I especially appreciated the size and resolution of the display for image editing. Although I don’t have any specific need for the pro-level wide color gamut, it’s there for those who do require it.</p><p> The base level Magic Keyboard swaps in a lock key for the TouchID button, which is less useful.</p><p> The M1 iMac comes with the latest version of the Magic Keyboard and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/magic-mouse-2-preview-2260679" >Magic Mouse 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , both appropriately color-matched. The Magic Keyboard offers full-sized keys for fairly comfortable typing, but the key travel is a bit shallower than I like. The biggest feature here is that the keyboard comes with an optional TouchID button.</p><p> While the TouchID option isn’t available with the base-level model I tested, I know from experience with the M1 MacBook Air that the inclusion of TouchID is a big productivity boost as it allows you to skip entering passwords and easily swap users.

The lightning charger connector is still inexplicably located on the bottom, so you can’t use it while charging, and it feels uncomfortably small in my hand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-built-in-speakers-and-decent-Bluetooth-for-wireless-headphones"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-built-in-speakers-and-decent-Bluetooth-for-wireless-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent built-in speakers and decent Bluetooth for wireless headphones"></a>Audio: Excellent built-in speakers and decent Bluetooth for wireless headphones</h2><p> The 2021 iMac packs in a surprisingly competent six-speaker system, with support for spatial audio, into its thin frame.

I spent most of my time with the iMac connected to an Eero Wi-Fi 5 network that I use because range is more important to me than speed, but I also tested it on a Wi-Fi 6 network and with an Ethernet adapter.</p><p> Network speeds were excellent, across the board, compared to other devices I’ve used and tested.</p><p> In addition to Wi-Fi and wired connections, the M1 iMac also features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-5-4160255" >Bluetooth 5.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The Bluetooth connection is primarily used to connect the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2, but I also used it with a pair of AirPods Pro and my Avantree Ario Podio headphones. Sound quality and range were both excellent thanks to the Bluetooth 5.0 support, and I was able to listen to music and podcasts throughout my house.</p><h2 id="Camera-1080P-FaceTime-camera"><a href="#Camera-1080P-FaceTime-camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera: 1080P FaceTime camera"></a>Camera: 1080P FaceTime camera</h2><p> The M1 iMac packs in a 1080P full HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facetime-2000237" >FaceTime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> camera that’s backed up by Apple’s M1 image signal processor. In practical terms, the camera turns in a uniformly decent image in a variety of light conditions—including low light where a lot of webcams really struggle. It’s a big improvement over the camera included with the MacBook Pro, although the image can look a bit soft or washed out in some lighting conditions.</p><p> Paired with the improved camera, the M1 iMac also includes a massively improved built-in microphone array. The three high-quality microphones leverage directional beamforming and a high signal-to-noise ratio to turn in surprisingly good results.</p><h2 id="Software-Big-Sur-with-some-beautiful-custom-backgrounds"><a href="#Software-Big-Sur-with-some-beautiful-custom-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="Software: Big Sur with some beautiful custom backgrounds"></a>Software: Big Sur with some beautiful custom backgrounds</h2><p> Like the first round of M1 Macs, the 2021 iMac ships with macOS 11.4 Big Sur. Apple built this version of macOS with the M1 hardware in mind, and each update has come with M1-only improvements. First and foremost, it has the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps natively, and the ability to run legacy Intel Mac apps via Rosetta 2.</p><p> Support for mobile apps is a little spotty, as a lot of apps don’t show up in the Mac App store. For example, smash hit Zelda-clone Genshin Impact isn’t available despite the fact it now supports controllers. Legacy Intel Mac app support is a lot better, and I didn’t run into any trouble running apps through Rosetta 2. Most notably, Photoshop ran without a hitch, and the Final Fantasy 14 client also ran surprisingly well.</p><p> Photoshop and other popular apps are slated to eventually get M1 support, but I’ve found Rosetta 2 to deliver more than acceptable performance in the meantime.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-Apple’s-M1-chip-and-a-visual-refresh"><a href="#What’s-New-Apple’s-M1-chip-and-a-visual-refresh" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: Apple’s M1 chip and a visual refresh"></a>What’s New: Apple’s M1 chip and a visual refresh</h2><p> The iMac (2021) has received a laundry list of changes and updates since the last entry in the line back in 2016. The biggest news is the inclusion of Apple silicon in the form of the M1 chip, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p> The overall design of the M1 iMac has been significantly revamped. Colors are back, and it has a 24-inch display, increased from 21.5-inch, despite the overall form factor being very similar. The speakers, microphone, and camera have all received big improvements as well, with the camera having been updated from a mediocre 720p shooter to a full HD 1080p sensor backed up by advanced image processing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Expensive-but-built-to-last"><a href="#Price-Expensive-but-built-to-last" class="headerlink" title="Price: Expensive, but built to last"></a>Price: Expensive, but built to last</h2><p> With an MSRP of $1,299.00 for the base model, and prices just going up from there, the M1 iMac is undeniably expensive. You can get a 24-inch Windows all-in-one for a lot less than that, but the iMac justifies its price with superior capabilities and styling. The combination of convenience and power makes this well worth the price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/X35BpUO8w1Zk_PhNSA9TmEgvZpE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iMacM12021_1-0dc585a074e64b749bea01aad82d498c.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac M1 (2021)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="M1-iMac-2021-vs-M1-Mac-mini"><a href="#M1-iMac-2021-vs-M1-Mac-mini" class="headerlink" title="M1 iMac (2021) vs. M1 Mac mini"></a>M1 iMac (2021) vs. M1 Mac mini</h2><p> This might seem like an odd comparison, but it’s an important one. The 2021 iMac and 2020 Mac mini have very similar hardware, with the major difference being the iMac is an all-in-one with a beautiful display, while the Mac mini doesn’t have a built-in display.</p><p> The reason this is an important comparison is the base 2020 Mac mini has an MSRP of $699.00, while an iMac with the same CPU and GPU has an MSRP of $1,499.00. That means you could feasibly pair a Mac mini with a 28-inch 4K display like the Asus VP28UQG and save about $500 compared to just buying an iMac.</p><p> While the M1 Mac mini is a powerful little machine with a great price tag, the iMac has a big advantage in its simplicity. It works right out of the box, without needing to shop for or set up any additional hardware, and it looks really nice too. It also has great speakers and a fantastic FaceTime cam, which you won’t get from a budget third party monitor.  </p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Trade in your Intel iMac for a splash of color.</strong></p><p> The new iMac (M1, 2021) is a massive improvement over its predecessor, offering excellent performance, a beautiful Retina display, great sound, and a slick, colorful look. Power users who need more memory or a more powerful graphics chip may want to wait for an update to the iMac Pro line, but just about everyone else should be satisfied by this hardware.  </p><!--

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you? If it’s worth the extra $10, stick with the DBPOWER 600A. If not, you can pick up the Beatit BT-D11 for a bit less money and otherwise get a strikingly similar unit.</p><p><strong><em>Aickar Car Jump Starter:</em></strong> Between these two it’s almost too close to call. While the Aickar costs a mere few dollars less, it also has better output current for more reliable jump starts.

Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-buyers-ultimate-guide/"><u>: A Buyer's Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-box-enthusiasm/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Box Enthusiasm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-creativity-time-lapse-on-samsung-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing Creativity  Time-Lapse on Samsung for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/adding-more-memory-to-my-computer-machine-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Adding More Memory to My Computer Machine: Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/affordable-excellence-unveiled-zte-blade-a3y-analysis-and-user-experience/"><u>Affordable Excellence Unveiled: ZTE Blade A3Y Analysis and User Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-dash-cams-in-depth-review-of-the-pruveeo-f5-1080p-camera/"><u>Budget-Friendly Dash Cams: In-Depth Review of the Pruveeo F5 1080P Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comparing-iphone-15-pro-max-and-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-which-one-reigns-supreme/"><u>Comparing iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Which One Reigns Supreme?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-the-ultimate-portable-android-device/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S4: The Ultimate Portable Android Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-battery-powered-google-nest-doorbell-evaluation/"><u>Comprehensive Battery-Powered Google Nest Doorbell Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-jackery-powerbar-unit-with-built-in-ac-outlet-capabilities/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the Jackery PowerBar Unit with Built-In AC Outlet Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-how-bouncies-connected-drive-device-offers-simple-navigation-for-less/"><u>Discover How Bouncie's Connected Drive Device Offers Simple Navigation for Less!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-the-benefits-of-synology-rt2ac-exceptional-longer-reach-and-effective-parental-control-functions-unveiled-in-our-review/"><u>Discover the Benefits of Synology RT2#AC: Exceptional Longer Reach and Effective Parental Control Functions Unveiled in Our Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/experience-a-great-convertible-and-inexpensive-asus-chromebook-with-our-detailed-review/"><u>Experience a Great, Convertible & Inexpensive Asus Chromebook with Our Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-top-rated-linksys-wrt3200acm-a-leading-open-source-wifi-solution/"><u>Expert Analysis: Top-Rated Linksys WRT3200ACM -

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms. Your colonists’ lives depend on it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Surviving Mars</li><li>Product Brand  Paradox Interactive</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>Release Date  March 2018</li><li>Available Platforms  Windows, Mac, PS4, Xbox</li><li>Processor Minimum  4th Generation Intel i3 CPU or equivalent</li><li>Memory Minimum  4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  HD 4600&#x2F;Geforce 620&#x2F;Radeon 6450 or equivalent GPUs with 1 GB of video RAM</li><li>Game Updates  Green Planet, Project Laika, Space Race, Colony Design Set, Marsvision Song Contest</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-achieve-epic-results-the-ultimate-guide-to-gopro-time-lapses/"><u>[New] Achieve Epic Results  The Ultimate Guide to GoPro Time-Lapses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-efficient-sound-capture-on-windows-10-part-1/"><u>[New] Efficient Sound Capture on Windows 10, Part 1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-high-end-photo-overlays-for-creative-texting/"><u>[New] High-End Photo Overlays for Creative Texting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-social-media-a-focus-on-snapchat-business/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Social Media  A Focus on SnapChat Business</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-switch-saving-gameplay-footage/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Switch  Saving Gameplay Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-samsung-ubd-k8500-refreshed-2023-overview-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Samsung UBD-K8500 Refreshed - 2023 Overview for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-iphones-secret-life-after-the-shot/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling iPhone's Secret Life After the Shot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-mastering-powerdirector-software/"><u>2024 Approved  The Complete Guide to Mastering PowerDirector Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-oppo-k11-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Oppo K11 5G?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> It’s difficult to go more than a few feet nowadays without coming across a power outlet (or at least a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), but on those rare occasions you’re away from any source of power, it’s nice to have a backup battery on hand for when your laptop or smartphone dies.</p><p> While there’s no shortage of options on the market, there aren’t many that can keep you going for days. That’s not the case with the MaxOak 50000mAh, an absolutely massive and robust charger that attempts to be the jack of all when it comes to charging gadgets on the go. It’s power comes at the cost of massive size and the charging ports aren’t too fast, but if you need tons of power, this is the battery pack to get.</p><h2 id="Design-Bulky-for-travelers"><a href="#Design-Bulky-for-travelers" class="headerlink" title="Design: Bulky for travelers"></a><strong>Design: Bulky for travelers</strong></h2><p> First and foremost, this thing is a tank. At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops. It also measures in at 8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 inches (HWD), making it quite the behemoth to lug around. A small detail regarding the weight of the MaxOak is that it isn’t balanced. The side without the ports holds a fair bit more weight than the side with the various ports. It’s not a significant detail, but one you might notice with time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SHsB9QkFaBbOrU6sw55TzNOqC7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_4Web-5c8ff4adc9e77c0001ff0b36.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> As for the materials, the metal enclosure and place ends give it a fairly solid feel, but the metal doesn’t sit perfectly flush with the plastic ends, at least not in our model. It could be a one-off quality control issue or it might simply be the way in which the charger is constructed, but it’s definitely noticeable.</p><p> The number of ports integrated into the charger is impressive. It includes four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032" >USB Type-A <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports—two 2.1A and two 1.0A—as well as two AC plug-in style connections—a 12-volt 2.5A plugin and a 20-volt 5.0A plugin. This offers a solid range of options for charging alongside the slew of connection<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-adapter-817585" >adapters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> MaxOak includes with the charger. That said, it would’ve been nice to see a USB Type-C port (or two) considering how ubiquitous they’re becoming.</p><p> At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops.</p><p> Charging the device is done via a small 16.8-volt 2.5A plug-in style port on the opposite side of the power button. Overall, the design is roughly what you’d expect from a 50000mAh laptop battery charger. Yes, it’s heavy, yes it’s quite beefy in size, but it comes with the territory.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around</strong></h2><p> Setting up the MaxOak laptop battery charger is as simple as it gets. After removing it from its unbranded cardboard box, it’s simply a matter of plugging it in and getting it charged up completely. Our device came charged at roughly 50% based on the onboard<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> battery indicator, but to complete our tests we wanted it charged entirely, which leads us to our biggest complaint about this charger.</p><p> The point of a charger is to have extra battery power on hand when needed so you don’t have to carry around unnecessary cables when traveling. Unfortunately, the MaxOak battery pack doesn’t use any kind of USB or standardized port. Rather than charging it with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even a micro-USB port, the MaxOak battery pack relies on its own proprietary power supply that’s nearly as large as most laptop chargers. Sure, the 50000mAh onboard is likely enough that you could leave both the battery pack charger and your laptop charger behind for most events, but eventually you’ll run out of juice and rather than reaching for a cable you would probably already have in your bag, you’re stuck bringing along a proprietary charger.</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh manages to charge at a decent rate considering its capacity, but we would’ve liked to see more high-powered ports for speedier charging. We charged and fully drained the MaxOak power bank five times and charging took roughly six to eight hours per recharge with an average of seven hours and fifteen minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FlP4JZUVLoJ3DjKoSRUIFuf1peY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_6Web-5c8ff3e6c9e77c0001a926ff.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> One nice bonus is the power bank can be charged while also giving a charge to a laptop or mobile device, adding an extra element of convenience.</p><p> Charging the power bank itself is only one half of the equation though—and arguably the less important half. More importantly, is how well it can charge other devices.</p><p> At 50000mAh&#x2F;185Wh, the MaxOak power bank offers one of the highest capacities out there for a device of its size. For mobile devices, we tested it on both a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active as well as an iPhone XS. For laptops, we tested it with an ASUS X555LA notebook.</p><p> The MaxOak power bank charged the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active just shy of twelve times from 0% to 100%. This aligns almost exactly with the 50000mAh capacity of the MaxOak power divided by the 4,000mAh capacity of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. We experienced similar results with the iPhone XS. While Apple doesn’t specifically mention the battery capacity of the iPhone XS, third parties have reported it to be approximately 2,700mAh, which would equate to roughly 18.5 full charges. In our tests, we were able to get 17.5 charges from the MaxOak power bank.</p><p> Moving onto laptops, our ASUS X555LA was able to be charged four and a half times from 0% with the MaxOak power bank, with an average charge time of three hours or so. The ASUS X555LA has a relatively small battery compared to most laptops, which means it falls in line with MaxOak’s claims that its power bank can charge a laptop two times over give or take a little.</p><h2 id="Price-Right-down-the-middle"><a href="#Price-Right-down-the-middle" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right down the middle"></a><strong>Price: Right down the middle</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh power bank comes in at $135.99 at the time of this review. This is a reasonable price when taking into consideration how much battery capacity you’re getting with it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-One-in-the-same"><a href="#Competition-One-in-the-same" class="headerlink" title="Competition: One in the same"></a><strong>Competition: One in the same</strong></h2><p> In terms of pure capacity, the MaxOak doesn’t have much competition. There are only two other 50000mAh power banks on Amazon: the Crave PowerPack and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Renogy-50000mAh-Portable-Generator-External/dp/B07CQCMZ4Q/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4589398%7Cn970af9c77c9d48e5afeadf350862a65723%7C" >Renogy power bank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and all of them use the_exact_ same design, just with different branding.</p><p> In terms of pure capacity, the MaxOak doesn’t have much competition.</p><p> The Crave PowerPack retails for $139.99, exactly $4 more than the MaxOak power bank, while the Renogy power bank retails for just $109.99, a full $25 less than the MaxOak power bank. Considering all three power banks appear to be identical to each other in capacity and accessories, the Renogy looks to be the best value.</p><p> Want to see how other brands compare?

However, it isn’t designed with newer computers and devices in mind. If you have an older laptop on hand that isn’t a MacBook (the MaxOak doesn’t support any MagSafe connectors) or doesn’t use USB Type-C for charging, it’ll get the job done. But if your smartphone or laptop is newer and relies on more recent and powerful connections, you’re going to want to look elsewhere.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jackery-powerbar-battery-pack-review-4589480" >Jackery PowerBar Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/chargetech-27000mah-battery-pack-review-4589409" >ChargeTech 27000mAh Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-powercore-26800-battery-pack-bundle-review-4589459" >Anker PowerCore+ 26800 Battery Pack Bundle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  185Wh&#x2F;50000mAh External Battery Power Bank</li><li>Product Brand  MAXOAK</li><li>Price  $135.99</li><li>Release Date  June 2015</li><li>Weight  2.77 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 in.</li><li>Color  Gunmetal</li><li>Removable Cables  Yes, included</li><li>Controls  Power button</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs  One DC20V 5A, one DC12V 2.5A, Four USB 5V</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  Android, iOS</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-how-creators-profit-from-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] How Creators Profit From YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-startups-best-friends-the-8-products-every-entrepreneur-should-collect/"><u>[New] Startup's Best Friends  The 8 Products Every Entrepreneur Should Collect</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-mastering-zero-cost-youtube-intros-essential-tips-and-templates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Zero-Cost YouTube Intros  Essential Tips & Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-avoiding-triggers-exiting-with-ease-from-discord-servers/"><u>[Updated] Avoiding Triggers  Exiting with Ease From Discord Servers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-mac-tool-seamless-screen-plus-voice-logging/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premium Mac Tool  Seamless Screen + Voice Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-retrace-footsteps-android-film-inversion/"><u>2024 Approved  Retrace Footsteps  Android Film Inversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-new-era-for-classic-design-in-depth-review-of-the-latest-lg-watch-style-featuring-wear-os-20-technology/"><u>A New Era for Classic Design: In-Depth Review of the Latest LG Watch Style Featuring Wear OS 2.0 Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/affordable-elegance-motorola-ones-iphone-like-appeal-at-half-the-price/"><u>Affordable Elegance: Motorola One's iPhone-Like Appeal at Half the Price</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-ospreys-cost-effective-weather-station-the-ambient-ws-2902a/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Osprey's Cost-Effective Weather Station -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Corsair One Pro is a gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that combines a clever water cooling setup with a custom tower design to deliver high performance in a surprisingly small form factor. It uses a solid, premium-looking custom aluminum and steel case to accomplish this, along with a tailor-made cooling solution that doesn’t waste an inch of internal real estate.</p><p> Corsair has been a venerated mainstay in the PC components world for a long time now, offering popular CPU coolers, power supplies, cases, memory, and a whole lot more. This is the first time, however, that they’ve decided to throw their hat in the ring of pre-built gaming desktops. This has provided a solid platform for Corsair to show off their engineering and design chops—an opportunity I certainly don’t think they’ve wasted.</p><p> These are all nice words, but the results speak for themselves. Small form factor PCs can easily suffer from heat limitations, noise problems, or both, but the Corsair One Pro delivers great gaming performance while still keeping both noise and temperatures down.</p><p> This has provided a solid platform for Corsair to show off their engineering and design chops.</p><p> The only area this model of the Corsair One Pro faces limitations is as a creative workstation—a maximum of 32GB of RAM is a limiting upper threshold for creatives looking for longevity out of their purchase. Regardless, anyone without extensive memory needs will surely find their needs met with Corsair’s desktop. Let’s see how the Corsair One Pro performs, and take a closer look at the design choices that were made and how they impact daily use of this tower.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WC9SY_zrilLIIn_IFlawIcQw3l0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-One-Pro-Desktop-Computer-2-567ca178cde846769c37ca84176d79b7.jpg"                      alt="Corsair One Pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design :Beautiful and compact"></a><strong>Design</strong> :<strong>Beautiful and compact</strong></h2><p> The first thing I noticed about the Corsair One Pro when taking it out of the box was how small it was, and I was already anticipating a small PC. The 12 Liter case measures just 7.8 x 6.9 x 14.9 inches (HWD)—absolutely minuscule by gaming desktop standards. They also manage to do all this without making the case look like a cheesy aesthetic nightmare designed by an 11-year-old with a Mountain Dew Code Red addiction. A feat, I know. Hats off to Corsair for designing a PC for adults.</p><p> The Corsair One Pro is also incredibly dense, which you will surely notice as soon as you pick it up for the first time. The entirely metal case and water cooling setup mean that the system weighs in at 16.3 pounds, which is not obscenely heavy by gaming PC standards, but still feels heavy relative to how small it is.</p><p> The Corsair One Pro is also incredibly dense, which you will surely notice as soon as you pick it up for the first time.</p><p> One of the first letdowns, however, is on the connectivity front. The back of the case offers 5 USB A ports - 3x USB 3, and 2x USB 2, as well as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not a wealth of options, but not too shocking from a mini-ITX<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motherboards-system-boards-and-mainboards-2618154" >motherboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and one of the sacrifices you make when you size down this much. The front of the case is a far bigger disappointment, offering a meager one USB port and one HDMI out. This is great if the only thing you use your front connections for is VR gaming, but this lack of connection options on the front means that you’re probably going to spend a lot of time craning your neck around the back of your case.</p><p> The Corsair One Pro doesn’t have a window to look into, and that’s probably because there wouldn’t be anything to look at. The internals are occupied by custom radiators on either side, and they have been cut to size specifically to fit the dimensions of the case. One of them services the CPU and the other the GPU, and both are designed to draw cool air directly from the exterior of the case. Corsair probably wouldn’t have been able to achieve the thermals that they have without this custom setup, as any standard AIO solution wouldn’t fit in here.</p><p> Most home computer builders scoff at the notion of paying a company a premium to put together a system for you—that’s supposed to be part of the fun! But if you were ever going to sway one of us, this is how you would do it. Put together a custom system using parts that I can’t just buy off a shelf, delivering something that I can’t easily make.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fx7g2Vg5VksuNwH4LThQhniEsg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-One-Pro-Desktop-Computer-3-51b17ae55a144069ac2ce72488200290.jpg"                      alt="Corsair One Pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-for-gaming-but-limited-RAM-for-video-editing"><a href="#Performance-Solid-for-gaming-but-limited-RAM-for-video-editing" class="headerlink" title="Performance : Solid for gaming, but limited RAM for video editing"></a><strong>Performance</strong> : <strong>Solid for gaming, but limited RAM for video editing</strong></h2><p> The Corsair One Pro that I tested featured an Intel Core i7-7700k processor, 32GB of RAM, a 480GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >M.2 NVMe drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a 2TB HDD, and an Nvidia GTX GeForce 1080 Ti graphics card.

It’s certainly enough memory if you don’t do much beyond gaming and web browsing, but it’s quite limiting for any creative applications like video editing and motion graphics.</p><p> In the productivity-focused benchmarking suite PCMark10, the Corsair One Pro scored a respectable 6,399, putting it marginally ahead of the average score of 6,187 across all systems tested with this CPU and GPU configuration.</p><p> On the gaming side, things were slightly less rosy, with the Corsair One Pro scoring an 8,602 in the synthetic gaming benchmark Time Spy in the 3DMark suite. Compare this with an average of 8,890 for systems with this hardware configuration. To put this in perspective, the average score on a system with a GTX 1080 instead of a 1080 Ti averages 7,180, so the Corsair One Pro is still doing just fine.</p><p> It’s certainly enough memory if you don’t do much beyond gaming and web browsing, but it’s quite limiting for any creative applications like video editing and motion graphics.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Everything-a-gaming-PC-needs"><a href="#Network-Everything-a-gaming-PC-needs" class="headerlink" title="Network :Everything a gaming PC needs"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Everything a gaming PC needs</strong></h2><p> The Corsair One Pro features<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >Gigabit Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2. While most serious users will want to get off of Wi-Fi and onto Ethernet as soon as they can, the presence of Wi-Fi is still very critical. Not everyone has access to Ethernet, or at least not right away, and sometimes being able to hop on Wi-Fi in a pinch makes all the difference.</p><p> I didn’t have any trouble on the networking front with either the Wi-Fi or the Ethernet. My test setup was about 50 ft from the nearest router in direct line of sight, so I didn’t expect too many issues, but I was happy with the stability that I enjoyed during testing.</p><h2 id="Software-A-light-touch"><a href="#Software-A-light-touch" class="headerlink" title="Software: A light touch"></a><strong>Software: A light touch</strong></h2><p> Software is definitely an area where most buyers appreciate seeing as little extra as possible, and Corsair certainly knows this. There isn’t a ton of flashy bloatware clogging the user experience of the Corsair One Pro, and we’re all the better for it. You can make use of the Corsair Link software, nonetheless, to monitor and manage the internals from the comfort of your windows desktop.</p><p> Corsair Link is capable of monitoring CPU, GPU, motherboard, and SSD temperatures and reports on fan speeds as well. Beyond this, you can configure settings of the subtle blue LED strips on the exterior of the case from here, toggling settings like light patterns and brightness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wD8iDgpKfKl5SxrOM7HcPorqmgw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-One-Pro-Desktop-Computer-5-d413b11c28bb49e0baada954e10dcb3a.jpg"                      alt="Corsair One Pro"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-premium-but-a-deserved-one"><a href="#Price-A-premium-but-a-deserved-one" class="headerlink" title="Price: A premium, but a deserved one"></a><strong>Price: A premium, but a deserved one</strong></h2><p> The Corsair One Pro as configured can be found online for between $1700-$1900, which is a pretty great deal for this system. I put together a comparable build on PCPartPicker and despite cutting a few corners still ended up at around $1600 all-in. A $100-300 premium for a well-built, compact desktop like this is incredibly reasonable by any measure.</p><p> My main concern if I was flirting with pulling the trigger on this system wouldn’t be if the price is fair, it would be if the older processor is going to hold me back in the future, and if I’m going to get enough longevity out of it to justify the price. Since you won’t be doing much in the way of upgrading this system, you’re more or less stuck with what you are buying.</p><p> Corsair has since released newer versions of the One with updated internals and a more sensible set of front-facing ports. The cheapest option from this newer generation, the Corsair One i145, will run you $2500 for an i7-9700F, RTX 2080, and 16GB of RAM. This is certainly less of a deal, but the newer models also offer even more power if you can expand your budget considerably.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b6k5YWyriZ_Y7470FGAcu1W_ff4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Corsair-One-Pro-Desktop-Computer-4-0587a464511c4a0c9b312ba9693af470.jpg"                      alt="Corsair One Pro"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Corsair-One-Pro-vs-HP-OMEN-Obelisk"><a href="#Corsair-One-Pro-vs-HP-OMEN-Obelisk" class="headerlink" title="Corsair One Pro vs HP OMEN Obelisk"></a><strong>Corsair One Pro vs HP OMEN Obelisk</strong></h2><p> These systems are quite different, inside and out, but they represent roughly the same effort: building an affordable high-performance gaming desktop in a smaller-than-average form factor. HP’s approach to this is in the form of the H<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-omen-obelisk-review-5072832" >P OMEN Obelisk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/desktops/omen-875" >HP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), which uses an Intel i9-9900k and 32GB of RAM in conjunction with an Nvidia RTX 2080 Super.</p><p> This particular model of the Corsair One Pro that I tested is handily outpaced by the HP OMEN Obelisk (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Obelisk-Computer-Processor-875-0020/dp/B07J4HLV2P/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5072820%7Cn263af6bf93484f57b41504a1366de95207%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) and for a relatively meager premium. The Obelisk can be found for around $2000, representing dramatically better value. The Obelisk is also a lot more upgradeable, with room for another 32GB of RAM and SATA cables already pre-wired to support an additional two hard drives.</p><p> While HP wins the price-to-performance battle, they lose to Corsair just about everywhere else. The OMEN Obelisk is louder, has worse thermals, and has a bigger footprint than the One Pro. The case is also constructed mainly of plastic, making it a bit more of a liability long-term. It’s not a simple case of a clear winner, but both of these systems have a lot to offer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A pre-built gaming PC fit for novices and veterans alike.</strong></p><p> Corsair has done an admirable job putting together a pre-built PC that can satisfy everyone from the total novice to the PC-building veteran. The Corsair One Pro is beautifully designed, space-efficient, quiet, and cool.

Onboard GPS is a huge selling point for shoppers who prefer to leave their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at home while they work out.</p><p> The improved Pure Pulse heart-rate tracking technology and active intensity minutes could offer more detailed goal tracking to some users. Android users can reply to texts and calls directly from the device. Fitbit Pay is supported, as are music integrations with Pandora, Deezer, and Spotify. Finally, voice assistant support comes from Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant (forthcoming), amplifying the wear-and-go convenience for busy routines.</p><p> I used the Versa 3 as my go-to tracker for runs, walks, and telling time, too. Overall it was almost unnoticeable on my wrist, when I could get the right fit, though I didn’t always have the easiest time interacting with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ceE1xxVfUTF44pCOtEXiO6JW_IA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-04-ef922812d0444da4a7277e91efe2fcf8.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-smart-looking"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-smart-looking" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and smart-looking"></a>Design: Sleek and smart-looking</h2><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 resembles prior versions of the model, though with softer and more rounded edges meant to better contour to the wrist and offer faster response times, according to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While the standard model that I tested came with a silicone infinity sport band, there are several fancier watch bands available, including a quick-release band—if you opt for a special edition. This would certainly be preferable to the basic black version I tested, which really does look like a sports watch rather than a “regular” watch.</p><p> The Versa 3 has an attractive AMOLED display with three brightness settings. Sometimes I found the display difficult to read while outside unless the screen was set to the brightest level. And the hidden button was difficult to interact with. Located on the left side of the watch face, the button recedes into the device and requires full and direct contact to engage, especially when in motion. Another awkward design aspect is the screen wake function. The automatic setting, triggered by the turn of the wrist, was often slightly slow, and using the button&#x2F;tap prompt also sometimes took several taps.</p><p> In running mode, GPS signal capture was mostly instant, but it also frequently dropped.</p><p> This smartwatch is capable of storing five different watch faces, and while they’re easy to find, downloading a new face, just like all apps—took quite a while. The SPO2 watch face is compatible with the Versa 3, but you’ll have to pay for the Fitbit Premium app subscription to access this data in any meaningful way.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Lightweight-for-all-day-wear"><a href="#Comfort-Lightweight-for-all-day-wear" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Lightweight for all-day wear"></a>Comfort: Lightweight for all-day wear</h2><p> I found the Fitbit Versa 3 to be pleasantly lightweight and easy to wear for the whole day. Sleeping with it was never an issue, and the sleep mode setting was easy to turn on for uninterrupted sleep. Showering with the device was also uneventful, though I found that the side button was somehow turned on by contact with the water. I’m not sure how this bodes for swimming workouts with this device, which it’s supposed to be able to handle with its 50-meter water resistance.</p><p> Shoppers looking for the best-fitting smartwatches for women will appreciate the standard small band and the option of swapping it out with the provided large band if you need extra notches. While comfortable to wear because of the light build, finding the right fit, especially after I briefly removed the watch, was a bit tricky at first. But once I got it in the right place, I barely noticed it over the course of a full day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R_j7dFFwnlWoGyar6N0dYZREqIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-02-8b212782c0f245459f26ffaa0e2982e2.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-Accuracy-slightly-questionable"><a href="#Performance-Accuracy-slightly-questionable" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Accuracy slightly questionable"></a>Performance: Accuracy slightly questionable</h2><p> In true Fitbit brand fashion, the Fitbit Versa 3 supports wellness in a big-picture way. There are over 20 different workout modes and several, such as running, elliptical exercise, swimming, biking, and aerobic workouts, are automatically detected.</p><p> I used the running mode most frequently and saved that activity as a shortcut, which made launching a workout speedy. In most cases, GPS signal capture was instant, but it also frequently dropped—though it came back pretty quickly. This could explain the discrepancy when compared to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-venu-review-4843916" >Garmin Venu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the course of several two- and three-mile runs. The Versa 3 lagged behind by as much as 30 seconds. Resting heart rate was also pretty off when compared to the Venu—faster by almost 8bpm (beats per minute)—and that’s the biggest gap I saw while on a run as well.</p><p> Generally, whether logging a run, walk, or weight training workout, I found it best to leave the display set to always on. Otherwise, it was nearly impossible to get the screen to wake when I needed it to. The default screen timeout is only 8 seconds, which is customizable. But in the interest of preserving battery life, I left it as-is, even though it didn’t provide a huge window of opportunity. While running especially, even with the display always on, getting the display to come on to pause or resume workouts wasn’t very smooth.</p><p> I found that the workout summary on the device itself is easy to follow and review, but the app provides more valuable insights, such as information about heart rate zones and active minute zones by cardio and fat burn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XaHqGkkkpkk1u4lozEYs71XuROc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-05-95e58759793b422db3ebd22cf177f2ba.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Lasts-for-a-solid-six-days"><a href="#Battery-Lasts-for-a-solid-six-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Lasts for a solid six days"></a>Battery: Lasts for a solid six days</h2><p> Like the Fitbit Sense, the Fitbit Versa 3 is supposed to last for over six days on a single charge when the display is not set to “always on.” My experience yielded six days before the battery was critically low. This could be because I chose to download and use the Fitbit SPO2 watch face that measures blood oxygen saturation. Fitbit says this face could accelerate the need for charging. Otherwise, I used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for about 30 minutes each day and only streamed music via Spotify for 2 hours total.</p><p> It charged from critically low to 100 percent in about 1.25 hours, which is in line with the 1-2 hour estimation by the manufacturer. A quick charge brought the device from 9 percent to 29 percent, which tracks with the claim that a 12-minute charge would bring it up to a full day of battery life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Key-Features-Wellness-and-convenience-features-reign"><a href="#Software-Key-Features-Wellness-and-convenience-features-reign" class="headerlink" title="Software&#x2F;Key Features: Wellness and convenience features reign"></a>Software&#x2F;Key Features: Wellness and convenience features reign</h2><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 runs on the Fitbit OS and benefits from several upgrades. The latest smart features include a built-in speaker and microphone, which Android users can use to respond to phone calls along with sending replies and emojis when the phone is nearby. Sadly, iPhone users can only answer or reject calls and view notifications.</p><p> Both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-vs-android-best-smartphone-2000309" >Android and iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users can also take advantage of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> voice prompts, which I found nice to have but limited and best for simple tasks such as setting reminders and timers. And since you have to launch the Alexa app itself to use, it makes sense to keep it in the list of app shortcuts. Additionally, the Fitbit app has to be active in the background for Alexa to work, so it’s hardly just as easy as calling out for Alexa to take advantage of the limited skills for this wearable.</p><p> It charged from critically low to 100 percent in about 1.25 hours, which is in line with the 1-2 hour estimation by the manufacturer.</p><p> For this particular device, the SPO2 monitoring is also a nice-to-have feature, but it only generates data based on a night of sleep, and the detailed metrics offered with the Fitbit Premium subscription don’t really get more detailed than showing a trend over time, in my opinion.</p><p> Unfortunately, I found that there’s little to do with this info. In fact, the printable wellness overview report doesn’t even include this data. The other wellness content, though, from meditation to recipes to workouts, all require the subscription, which the brand seems to be banking on enticing users to sign up for.</p><p> Another noteworthy upgrade for this model is the music streaming integration, which is a hit if you have a premium subscription to Deezer or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pandora-internet-music-streaming-1847453" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for on-device music storage. Otherwise, it’s more of a miss. Even if you’re a Spotify Premium user, at this point you can’t store music on the device. While it was somewhat convenient to control the Spotify mobile app from the Versa 3 rather than reaching for my phone, overall this feature wasn’t very incentivizing to use—especially since I couldn’t store music on the watch while on a run without my smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2f-G8JEK0Z63WAJEd2yrsI_9jDg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Versa-3-03-00c26852cbc94711a4bb6660b02e2550.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Less-costly-than-similar-models"><a href="#Price-Less-costly-than-similar-models" class="headerlink" title="Price: Less costly than similar models"></a>Price: Less costly than similar models</h2><p> For $230, the Fitbit Versa 3 is less expensive than similar feature-rich smartwatches. Other models like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2, come with available LTE, for even more connectivity and standalone convenience—and a significant price bump.</p><p> The Versa 3 is also about $100 cheaper than the Fitbit Sense, which offers a few more wellness-tracking flourishes such as the ECG app and EDA responses. The smartwatch claims to offer similarly accurate heart rate monitoring and onboard GPS and some users will still benefit from the array of wellness-centric features like reminders to move, food and water tracking, guided breathing, and all the smart features the more costly Sense has too.</p><h2 id="Fitbit-Versa-3-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2"><a href="#Fitbit-Versa-3-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Versa 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2"></a>Fitbit Versa 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2</h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is a close comparison to the Fitbit Versa 3. If you opt for GPS and cellular connectivity, it will cost about $380 and above, but you’ll also get a slew of additional smart features that surpass the Versa 3. You can take phone calls over Wi-Fi, control your camera, check social feeds, and listen to music on your run without your phone in your pocket.</p><p> In true Fitbit brand fashion, the Fitbit Versa 3 supports wellness in a big-picture way.</p><p> The Active2 has the same water-resistance rating as the Versa 3, but it’s also military-grade rugged. The round watch face and larger display are also potentially more appealing to traditional watch fans that want an accessory that transitions better from work to workouts. There are two buttons as well for easier interactions.</p><p> The Versa 3 has the upper hand when it comes to battery life. The Active2 will get you through the day, but not to (or potentially over) six days like the Versa 3. On the other hand, the Active2 can be charged using power share with compatible<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >Samsung smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a convenience the Versa 3 doesn’t offer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An effective fitness smartwatch that could compel some users to keep moving.</strong></p><p> The Fitbit Versa 3 is a lightweight wearable that offers an attractive blend of fitness and wellness-tracking tools and connected features. New on-device GPS, enhanced heart-rate monitoring, music controls, and the companion app could provide some users an easy deep dive into wellness trends along with desirable customization power. Those looking for added motivation to stay active may find it in this comfortable and capable wearable.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Versa 3</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>MPN  FB511BKBK</li><li>Price  $229.95</li><li>Release Date  August 2020</li><li>Weight  0.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.59 x 1.59 x 0.49 in.</li><li>Color  Black&#x2F;Black Aluminum, Midnight&#x2F;Soft Gold Aluminum, Olive &#x2F; Soft Gold Aluminum, Pink Clay&#x2F;Soft Gold Aluminum, Thistle &#x2F; Soft Gold Aluminum</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-asgard-unleashed-echoes-of-ragnarok/"><u>[New] Asgard Unleashed  Echoes of Ragnarök</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-simple-steps-to-curve-an-image-in-photoshop/"><u>[New] Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-chat-enhancement-course-turning-your-graphics-into-social-media-stickers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Chat Enhancement Course  Turning Your Graphics Into Social Media Stickers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-simplifying-screen-views-during-google-meet-chats-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Simplifying Screen Views During Google Meet Chats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-spark-engagement-the-ultimate-list-of-video-text-effects/"><u>[Updated] Spark Engagement  The Ultimate List of Video Text Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-scripting-instant-stopwatch-integration-in-obs/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Scripting  Instant Stopwatch Integration in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-funnyframefactory-imggigglesworkshop/"><u>2024 Approved  FunnyFrameFactory  ImgGigglesWorkshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-yokus-adventure-in-island-express/"><u>A Comprehensive Review of Yoku’s Adventure in Island Express</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-things-you-need-to-know-about-wipe-datafactory-reset-for-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>All Things You Need to Know about Wipe Data/Factory Reset For Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/asus-chromebook-flip-c302ca-unveiled-amazing-performance-at-an-outstanding-low-price-point/"><u>Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA Unveiled: Amazing Performance at an Outstanding Low Price Point.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/breaking-down-manycams-recording-capabilities-for-professionals/"><u>Breaking Down ManyCam's Recording Capabilities for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comparing-the-latest-giants-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-against-the-former-beast-s21-ultra/"><u>Comparing the Latest Giants: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Against the Former Beast, S21 Ultra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-the-netgear-nighthawk-c7000-top-tier-wireless-router-unveiled/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 -

The Switch is one of Nintendo’s best-selling devices ever, despite hardware that lags behind the competition in terms of power. The Switch Lite builds on that success with similar hardware, complete compatibility, and an even more portable form factor.</p><p> Where the original Switch is a hybrid portable console, the Switch Lite is a more traditional handheld gaming device. It still provides most of the best features of the full-sized Switch, but it’s also Nintendo’s only pure portable since the discontinuation of the 3DS family of handhelds.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EUqklfDyxuB1ye8-DBboDrjzkUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-2-225f5107c7b74f159afecba8c3f6174a.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Cute-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Cute-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cute and compact"></a><strong>Design: Cute and compact</strong></h2><p> It’s hard not to swoon at the sight of the Switch Lite. The handheld console is cute and compact, featuring unique color options, bright white buttons, and joysticks wrapped around a downsized screen. The whole unit is about the size of a beefy phablet. The screen alone is about the size of an iPhone SE.</p><p> Compared to its larger cousin, this device is light and slim, with a smooth matte surface that spills across the entire unit in a beautiful, uninterrupted fashion. Whereas the regular Switch creates a stark contrast between each Joy-Con and the console, the Lite is one continuous body that creates a sleeker look and sturdier feel.</p><p> Looking at both Switches side-by-side, the Lite isn’t massively smaller in comparison, but it seems that way when you swap between the two. The reduction in size and weight doesn’t make it challenging to use for those with larger hands.</p><p> The screen has been decreased from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches, still sporting the same plastic overlay above it (meaning you’ll want to get a glass protector to prevent scratches), and the length and height have been trimmed down a good bit. The most obvious change here is the overall length of the Lite, which is slimmer by roughly the size of an entire Joy-Con on one side.</p><p> The smaller size is because the regular Switch has removable controllers, and the Lite does not. The compromise on its size is that you can’t take your Joy-Cons off and instantly start playing a local multiplayer game. Although that might be disappointing for some, the Lite now feels much better for long handheld gaming sessions when compared to the bulkier model.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p> Aside from the lack of removable controllers, the Lite features the same layout as the Joy-Con inputs, down to the spacing and functions. On the left are two shoulder buttons, a minus button (select), a joystick, a directional pad, and a screenshot button. The right side is mostly the same, with two more shoulders, a plus button (start), four inputs, another joystick, and a home button.</p><p> The only real notable difference here is that Nintendo has opted for a traditional D-pad, which is leagues better than the old layout for platformers, fighting games, and pretty much everything else. This distinction is, of course, because you’ll no longer be removing the left controller and requiring it to function as a separate device.</p><p> The top is home to the power button and volume toggle, a vent, a 3.5mm jack, and the game card slot, while the bottom holds the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input for power and the addition of a new standalone SD card slot.</p><p> Where there’s usually a kickstand on the Switch with a hidden SD card slot, this version drops that option (since you can no longer remove the Joy-Con for tabletop mode) and adds a small door for expanding your storage. The kickstand was flimsy anyway, so you likely won’t miss it.</p><p> There’s still the issue with the USB-C port sticking straight out of the bottom, making it hard to sit flat against something, but this is somewhat less annoying since you’ll likely be holding it while gaming. Unfortunately, the Lite does not fit into the dock that came with a Switch. If you want to charge it, you have to plug it directly into the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB-C charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the one on a regular Switch, as they’re the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7502vZ1Vh2D4nRux6hEnq4BL3Rk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-5-2fb7aa309cc54dd79c07bd799ef7fe84.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch"><a href="#Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Hit the switch"></a><strong>Setup Process: Hit the switch</strong></h2><p> If you’ve set up a previous Switch console in the past, the process here is mostly the same, but it’s even easier since there are no Joy-Cons.</p><p> Since the Lite is exclusively handheld, there’s no dock to worry about here, but make sure your console has enough juice before beginning setup. Setup starts with pushing the power button on the top and is facilitated by an on-screen guide that helps you set up the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, account creation (or login), etc. When complete, either pop in a game card or download one digitally to begin gaming.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> When you link your Nintendo account during setup, you can choose which Switch you want to be your primary system and which will be your secondary. That means that Nintendo essentially makes you decide to set up the Switch Lite as a secondary system that can only play your games while logged in and connected to Wi-Fi, or you can transfer the old Switch’s data to the new one.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> If you opt to make your Lite the secondary, you can kiss goodbye to playing any of your digital games on the go unless you have stable Wi-Fi on hand. Because of this, I decided to make my docked Switch the secondary (since it is always at home with Wi-Fi access).</p><p> While this does solve most of the issues, it’s annoying that it forces you to choose. Other systems, like Xbox, only allow one “home” console to play your games without being logged in, but it’s less of an issue since those consoles aren’t portable.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap). However, none of this data migration will happen automatically like other gaming consoles. You’ll need to manually download your saves locally each time and then update them on the console you want to use, even with the cloud option.</p><p> Sure, all of this does work, but it’s a pain to do and feels like another shortsighted attempt from Nintendo in a world where other competitors are leagues ahead. With other consoles and PC platforms like Steam, your saved data syncs to the cloud automatically, allowing you to play wherever you want without worrying about losing progress.</p><p> There’s yet another issue if you have kids or multiple accounts on your Switches. Since one Switch is now set as your primary, other users can’t access all your games from a secondary console.</p><p> For example, if you set the Switch Lite as your primary system, nobody can play games you’ve bought and downloaded on your home Switch unless they log into your account. You could always keep that other Switch as your primary, but then your Switch Lite will need Wi-Fi to access titles. It’s easy to see the problem there, but apparently, Nintendo doesn’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kQx9K3tATPBWAMgyJJymqBqYPao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-3-7349fa7d79f34dbaa50c25cb59aec820.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD"><a href="#Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD"></a><strong>Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD</strong></h2><p> Much like the original Switch, the Lite is by no means a powerhouse console sporting top-of-the-line graphics and hardware. That said, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The Switch Lite performs similarly to its larger counterpart while in handheld mode, but let’s delve into specifics.</p><p> Sporting the same custom Tegra X1 from Nvidia, the Switch Lite has plenty of CPU and GPU power for its humble needs. The screen maxes out at a 720p resolution, which isn’t great but gets the job done on such a small screen. Since you can’t use the Switch Lite with a dock, there’s no way to play in 1080p.</p><p> Although the screen is reduced from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches on the Lite, I didn’t notice a big difference. The Lite’s display packs more pixels per inch (PPI) at 267 PPI compared to the original Switch’s 236 PPI. The display looks sharper, but with such a marginal difference, most won’t notice much.</p><p> I’ve played many games on the Switch Lite, including modern classics like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Let’s Go, and Shovel Knight. All these had a solid performance from the console, with no considerable dips in frames, hiccups, or freezes.</p><p> Like its predecessor’s mobile mode, the Switch Lite is unfortunately capped at 30 FPS for many titles (though it can hit 60 in some single-player games). Unlike the Switch, which you can dock to boost performance, you’re stuck with the handheld specs on the Lite.</p><p> A quick example is that single-player Mario Kart 8 Deluxe runs at a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p on a docked Switch but 720p at 60 FPS in the handheld mode. Adding more players reduces your frames to 30 FPS, which is also true for Smash Bros. The Switch Lite isn’t designed for single-device multiplayer, though, and you’re unlikely to get three or more players all crouched behind the 5.5-inch screen anyway.</p><p> These somewhat disappointing performance numbers look bad compared to a home console but remember that this is a handheld console that you can play for hours on end without needing a power cable.</p><p> If you’re like me and love to use the previous Switch in handheld mode for single-player games, the Lite will quickly become your go-to Switch for this particular setting. I’d even argue that this is perhaps the ideal way you should use it.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap).</p><p> Since the Switch Lite doesn’t have detachable Joy-Cons, you’ll need to bring an extra controller if you want to play local multiplayer games on the go. It works the same way as the original console, but it’s far less practical on the Lite since you can’t dock it, it doesn’t have a kickstand, you need separate controllers, and the screen is smaller. The option is there if you want, but this isn’t the Switch for you if you want to do local multiplayer.</p><p> Online multiplayer does, however, work pretty well. Boot up a game like Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., or your favorite free-to-play shooter and connect to the internet just like you would on the original Switch. For most matchmaking, however, you’ll need to pick up Nintendo’s online subscription service<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This service is inexpensive at just $20 a year (or $35 a year for a family plan that allows up to eight users, also available at $4 a month), but many remain frustrated with its capabilities. It includes cool perks, like access to a growing library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games, the Nintendo Switch Online smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, and special offers for members.</p><p> Once again, there’s no Ethernet port, so you can stick with Wi-Fi and hope for the best or grab an aftermarket adapter, which is far less practical on the Lite, seeing how it’s handheld only.</p><p> Online games have worked well for me, despite needing to rely on Wi-Fi. However, Nintendo’s online service is still far behind the likes of Sony or Microsoft, and the lack of a wired connection means you may run into issues with speed and stability if your Wi-Fi isn’t great.</p><p> Frustrations like the lack of in-game chat cripple the Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo has done little to address these issues. Many functions still require you to use the app on your smartphone (like online voice chat), and while Xbox and PlayStation users get free games for their consoles as part of their subscription services, Switch users only get older virtual console games.</p><p> All said and done, the performance is excellent for single-player experiences on the Switch Lite, with online multiplayer trailing behind but perfectly functional. Local multiplayer is easily one of the biggest strengths of the original Switch and our favorite aspect. However, the methods used to create a more portable console with the Lite also severely hurt its viability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KxMaFgooi4rm3qbImmLKatuUtVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-4-ef84dbbbde3d48ff97515e5c6b9981a4.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy"><a href="#Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy"></a><strong>Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy</strong></h2><p> If you’ve got an older Switch already or at least spent some time with one, the software found on the Switch Lite is exactly the same. Thankfully, that means it’s clean and snappy, but also a bit boring.</p><p> Booting up your Switch takes you to a quick start screen that allows you to either jump back into your recently used game or go straight to the main home screen by pressing the home button. This home screen provides a horizontal scrolling line of tiles for your games and apps, arranged by what you’ve recently used. Moving down to the lower row provides access to stuff like news, the eShop, screenshots, controller settings or the console’s settings.</p><p> Although you likely won’t be using Joy-Cons too often with the Lite, the bottom right will display your current controller setup so you know what’s connected. There’s also a handy little guide for what buttons you can use to interact with the options on screen. Up top, your profile and friends list can be accessed alongside a clock, a Wi-Fi meter, and a battery gauge.</p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld.</p><p> While the overall UI is quick and navigable, it feels drab. There are still no themes to swap aside from a simple light or dark mode, so don’t get too lofty with your customization ideas.</p><p> The biggest strength of the UI might be that you can use the touchscreen for most functions outside of games. Navigating the screen by tapping elements is even easier than using the controllers, and having an on-screen keyboard means typing out names and info is as easy as texting on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eFyBn6jL7cdHOO4q7zc6pALdQzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-6-42a5bc5ea4e544bdb6d3fbbd074583c2.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

It eventually received a bigger battery in a minor hardware revision, which helped. The Switch Lite has a slightly smaller battery than the revised Switch but also has lower power needs due to its small screen.</p><p> The Lite comes equipped with a 3,570mAh lithium-ion battery (compared to the 4,310mAh on the first Switch) that promises 3 to 7 hours of runtime. That extensive range exists because some activities on the console are far less demanding than others.</p><p> This slight bump in battery life is primarily due to the Switch Lite’s smaller screen, which needs less juice. Charging the battery takes about three hours, but only if you drain it completely. Using it occasionally instead of for extended gaming sessions, I’ve found that I don’t need to charge it that often and that it charges fast when I do.</p><p> Demanding titles like Breath of the Wild will still place you on the shorter end of that battery life spectrum, but I could log about 3.5-4 hours even with Zelda. Indie games and others that are less power-hungry can get you up to 5 hours and above. Note that you can tweak settings like brightness, Wi-Fi, and airplane mode to give even more screen time.</p><p> A portable charger is still one of the best accessories you can pick up for the Switch, and there are many quality options out that are approved by Nintendo. I recommend picking one up, but be careful which one you choose. I’ve stuck with reputable brands and haven’t had any trouble, but I have heard horror stories from people who have bricked their consoles with unsupported options.</p><p> Lastly, the battery is internal, so you can’t easily pop in a new one when it starts to degrade. While I haven’t seen any degradation with mine, it’ll happen at some point. When it does, sending it to Nintendo for repair is the only real option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

The Switch is already at a pretty sweet price of $300, so how does the Lite stack up?</p><p> The Switch Lite has an MSRP of $200, which is a pretty good value. It plays all the same games as the original Switch at a significantly lower price and is much more portable. You do lose the ability to dock it; for some people, that feature will be worth the extra $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7XA6hgAK2B4hDSlWdmB8VQddrjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-7-Comparison-44dcf88ec51247a2b0756445a3c7884d.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch"></a><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor to the Switch Lite is the original Switch. Nintendo has done an excellent job with both of these devices, but they each have some strengths and weaknesses you should consider before buying.</p><p> The first thing to consider is whether you want to play couch co-op or versus with your friends. If you plan to use your Switch primarily for playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch. You need the original Switch to play on a larger screen, and it also comes with two Joy-Cons that you can use as separate controllers.</p><p> Even if you wanted to play with one other person locally on your Switch Lite, you’d need to spend about $60-70 on some Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller, thus nearly reaching the price of the full-sized console.</p><p> If you plan to use your Switch primarily for stuff like playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch.</p><p> If you feel like you’ll use your Switch away from home, or you’re primarily a solo player who plans to focus on single-player games or online multiplayer, the Switch Lite is equally good here. The main difference is that the Lite can only be used in handheld mode and takes a slight hit in resolution. The strengths of the Switch Lite are that it’s ultra-compact and portable, so if you mainly want something to take with you from place to place, it’s the better bet.</p><p> The Switch Lite also makes a great companion device if you already have a Switch. If you have both, you get the best of both worlds—the Lite’s portability and the regular Switch’s extra features.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Perfect for gamers who prefer handheld.</strong></p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld. It features an extensive library of exclusives that are perfect for a highly mobile system like Animal Crossing—and it’s hard to argue with the price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-s-review-5085770" >Xbox Series S Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Switch Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Nintendo</li><li>UPC  070004640519</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  9.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.6 x 8.2 x 0.55 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year warranty</li><li>CPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>GPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB internal, one micro SD slot (up to 2TB)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Screen  Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen &#x2F; 5.5-inch LCD Screen &#x2F; 1280 x 720</li><li>Battery  Lithium-ion battery&#x2F;3570mAh</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-blur-it-out-simplified-identity-obscuration-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Blur It Out  Simplified Identity Obscuration Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-charting-success-navigating-a-3-step-strategy-for-tracking-youtube-income/"><u>[New] Charting Success  Navigating a 3-Step Strategy for Tracking YouTube Income</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-infusing-new-life-into-old-images-with-instagram-magic-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Infusing New Life Into Old Images with Instagram Magic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-premier-networks-global-gems-with-local-spectacles-2024/"><u>[Updated] Premier Networks  Global Gems with Local Spectacles, 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/are-you-still-using-an-ipad-could-it-be-time-for-a-tech-upgrade/"><u>Are You Still Using an iPad?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-change-facebook-cover-photo/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Change Facebook Cover Photo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-instagram-hashtags-you-need-to-start-using-today/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 Instagram Hashtags You Need to Start Using Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-avoiding-social-media-isolation-tweet-on-fb/"><u>[New] Avoiding Social Media Isolation  Tweet on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maximize-your-android-experience-with-these-top-5-ps2-games-apps/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maximize Your Android Experience with These Top 5 PS2 Games Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-quick-stitching-together-synchronizing-obs-and-zoom/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Quick Stitching Together  Synchronizing OBS and Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-every-degree-top-9-techniques-for-vr-filmmaking/"><u>2024 Approved  Explore Every Degree  Top 9 Techniques for VR Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-space-optimization-mastery-premium-storage-reviews/"><u>2024 Approved  Space Optimization Mastery  Premium Storage Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/affordable-excellence-the-arcshell-ar-5-user-guide-and-in-depth-assessment/"><u>Affordable Excellence: The ArcShell AR-5 User Guide & In-Depth Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/asus-vivobook-11-assessment-compact-budget-friendly-multipurpose-notebook-evaluation/"><u>Asus Vivobook 11 Assessment: Compact, Budget-Friendly, Multipurpose Notebook Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/best-indoor-antennas-showdown-how-the-1byone-digital-tv-signal-booster-outperforms-its-competitors-on-a-shoestring-budget/"><u>Best Indoor Antennas Showdown: How the 1BYONE Digital TV Signal Booster Outperforms Its Competitors on a Shoestring Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/design-tips-for-captivating-facebook-slideshows-for-2024/"><u>Design Tips for Captivating Facebook Slideshows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/dive-into-our-nook-glowlight-plus-review-with-barnes-and-noble-how-bigger-is-better-for-reading-devices/"><u>Dive Into Our Nook GlowLight Plus Review with Barnes & Noble: How Bigger Is Better for Reading Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-opinion-unveiling-the-elegance-and-flexibility-of-the-dell-xps-13-7390-ultrabook-review/"><u>Expert Opinion: Unveiling the Elegance and Flexibility of the Dell XPS 13 (7390) Ultrabook Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-soft-reset-nokia-c110-phone-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Soft Reset Nokia C110 phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/huion-inspiroy-g10t-tablet-an-ultimate-guide-to-its-exceptional-durability-and-superior-drawing-capabilities/"><u>Huion Inspiroy G10T Tablet: An Ultimate Guide to Its Exceptional Durability & Superior Drawing Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-guide-to-honor-magic-vs-2-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Easy Guide to Honor Magic Vs 2 FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/is-opting-for-applecareplus-coverage-worth-your-money-in-the-long-run-lets-find-out/"><u>Is Opting for AppleCare+ Coverage Worth Your Money in the Long Run?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The scarcity of many new high-end PC components left me with few options to get my hands on new hardware, that is unless I went all out and bought a brand-new top-of-the-line gaming PC. The build I picked out from iBuypower spares virtually no expense, using bleeding-edge hardware that would turn most gamers green with envy. This includes an RTX 3090 GPU from Gigabyte and an AMD 5900X CPU. Some other bells and whistles include a liquid cooler from NZXT and Corsair RGB fans.</p><p> The financial gap between building your own system and getting one built for you has reduced drastically in recent years, and while you can’t put a price tag on the sense of pride you get from building your own system, there are a number of advantages that come along with any pre-built system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-Yd3Z0BkdWgnQdWxmIOCYBiMsHw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_02-3bb3b230aee74044b05f544b6a8dffb7.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Purchase-and-Setup-Process-The-personal-touch"><a href="#Purchase-and-Setup-Process-The-personal-touch" class="headerlink" title="Purchase and Setup Process: The personal touch"></a>Purchase and Setup Process: The personal touch</h2><p> Builders like iBuyPower can provide you with tech support when you need it, a warranty for replacement parts, access to hardware that might otherwise be unavailable, and having someone handle the more tedious aspects of building a system like cable management. All of these services really add up, especially for anyone that may be buying a system as a gift or doesn’t have the necessary skills to troubleshoot one themselves.</p><p> While the delivery of my system was significantly delayed due to the general scarcity of the hardware, I was still given frequent status updates following the entire process from order placement to delivery. Any time I needed to contact an actual person, I was able to get in touch quickly, waiting no more than a few minutes to speak with a human being.</p><p> iBuypower is a bit of a rarity among ISBs and other boutique PC builders. Plenty of builders can offer you PCs at different price points to fit nearly<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-budget-pcs-832103" >any budget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , however, it’s often disappointing to see a shortage of options when it comes to hardware. One of the main draws of building your own system is being able to pick and choose your own parts, but you’ll often find builders that either use entirely proprietary hardware, or have limited options. However, iBuypower, when compared with other ISBs has the most impressive selection of hardware I’ve seen, with a broad range of proprietary and name-brand hardware to choose from allowing you to mix and match to your heart’s content.</p><p> The only category where I would have liked to see more of a selection was the chassis. There are plenty of standard options available, but if you’re in the market for a desktop that breaks the mold from an aesthetics standpoint you may be a little disappointed.</p><p> iBuypower, when compared with other ISBs has the most impressive selection of hardware I’ve seen, with a broad range of proprietary and name-brand hardware to choose from allowing you to mix and match to your heart’s content.</p><h2 id="Support-Experience-Patience-is-a-virtue"><a href="#Support-Experience-Patience-is-a-virtue" class="headerlink" title="Support Experience: Patience is a virtue"></a>Support Experience: Patience is a virtue</h2><p> While it would be easy to review the individual components in our system, I’m instead going to be focusing on the performance and aesthetics of the system as a whole as well as the overall service I received from iBuypower.</p><p> While I was pleasantly surprised at the promptness and professionalism of their customer service, I took things a step further by calling them with a request for technical support. The system I received, arrived in pristine condition and without any issues, but I gave them a call to see how they would respond to a fairly common error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_jBkcPEBjyyGVwoIDCwmSWQgdI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_03-efdbffee4fd8432e9bec6bbbb704b7b0.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

Thankfully, their support ran us through a quick troubleshoot of our problem and were able to resolve the issue quickly without the need to return our system. Being able to quickly discern simple problems pay real dividends when purchasing these systems for anyone that doesn’t necessarily have a technical aptitude for PCs.</p><p> While current circumstances and shortages of certain hardware are largely to blame for our system taking so long to arrive, bear in mind that even ordering a system with in-stock components may take as long as a month to reach you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OjE0wWcluyf52Y5uf0S9JXM3qFM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_04-c215a663f64e420293eec8c248103a70.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-More-bounce-for-the-ounce"><a href="#Design-More-bounce-for-the-ounce" class="headerlink" title="Design: More bounce for the ounce"></a>Design: More bounce for the ounce</h2><p> The matte black metallic case from NZXT is about as simple as they come, but what it lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for in usability. It features cable routing channels throughout the back panel, complete with Velcro straps and loops for tying down bundles of cables. The system builder put those to good use as there was very little in the way of loose cables when I opened the back panel.</p><p> A tempered glass side panel provides you with an excellent view of the hardware inside and is held in place by a single thumbscrew on the back of the system.</p><p> The mid-tower sized case features plenty of real estate for upgrades, including several mounts for SATA SSDs and HDDs in both the front and back. The size of the case also offers numerous options for cooling with 360mm radiator support along the top or front and space for a rear-mounted 140mm fan. There are very few screws holding everything in place, making disassembling everything relatively simple, and in my opinion, the fewer screws you have to keep track of, the better.</p><p> While you might think by looking at the case, that the system might be starved for ventilation, the H710 features perforated edges that give the hardware ample airflow. A tempered glass side panel provides you with an excellent view of the hardware inside and is held in place by a single thumbscrew on the back of the system.</p><p> There are plenty of pre-built options that allow you to swap out components based on your budget, but very few that allow for the level of customization you can get with a dealer like iBuyPower. While manufacturers like Dell and HP can certainly offer better budget options when it comes to gaming PCs, iBuyPower is the team to beat for anyone looking for a very specific build or access to top of the line parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-qQXXO0Uc5XYVpt1sO3ttNAdVJE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_04-fd15f80f7470451ab0d982aa7cb271c6.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Performance-UFOs-and-Big-Rigs"><a href="#Performance-UFOs-and-Big-Rigs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: UFOs and Big Rigs"></a>Performance: UFOs and Big Rigs</h2><p> I used a variety of both organic and synthetic benchmarks to stress test the system to see how it would hold up. I was pleased to find it blew away benchmarks for competing systems and was able to handle the most demanding games I threw at it.</p><p> Synthetic benchmarks included UniEngine Superposition and Cinebench R23, which are both free tools that anyone can access to stress their systems GPU and CPU respectively. I’ve also included benchmarks from other systems I’ve recommended showing how it stacks up against the parts used in a competing Alienware rig.</p><p> <strong>Cinebench R23</strong></p><p> AMD 5900X</p><p> Single:1553</p><p> Multi:18983</p><p> Intel i7-10700KF</p><p> Single: 1309</p><p> Multi: 12678</p><p> <strong>Superposition (4K Ultra)</strong></p><p> Gigabyte RTX 3090</p><p> Score: 16096</p><p> Avg FPS: 120.39</p><p> Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090</p><p> Score: 13947</p><p> Avg FPS: 103</p><p> <strong>Troy: A Total War Saga (4K Ultra)</strong></p><p> Battle: 57.98 Avg FPS</p><p> Campaign: 60 Avg FPS</p><p> Siege: 60 Avg FPS</p><p> <strong>Gears Tactics (4K Ultra)</strong></p><p> 59.9 Avg FPS</p><p> <strong>Borderlands 3 (4K Ultra)</strong></p><p> 59.93 Avg FPS</p><p> Being able to quickly discern simple problems pay real dividends when purchasing these systems for anyone that doesn’t necessarily have a technical aptitude for PCs.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-value-despite-the-sticker-price"><a href="#Price-Great-value-despite-the-sticker-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great value despite the sticker price"></a>Price: Great value despite the sticker price</h2><p> I used PC parts picker to assemble a list of all the components I used in the build and was pleasantly surprised to find very little was tacked on as a premium. If we had chosen to build this system ourselves, it would have cost us a grand total of $4,600 before tax, which is remarkably close to what I paid iBuypower to make the system for me ($4,562). Bear in mind that I also get access to tech support, a 1-year warranty as well as the actual assembly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZNgdquPbxQTjbSdNS2MbGVdghT0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_05-9982bf92d93746189e3b4fe68526bea0.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><p>Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> Using iBuypower for your next PC build is an excellent value. While it isn’t the most efficient way to shop for parts from a perspective of cost, it is at present the only way to get a tailor-made PC with higher-end components like AMD Zen 3 CPUs and Nvidia 30-series graphics cards. The value becomes even more apparent if you happen to lack the technical knowledge to build or service a gaming PC yourself.</p><p> While manufacturers like Dell and HP can certainly offer better budget options when it comes to gaming PCs, iBuyPower is the team to beat for anyone looking for a very specific build or access to top of the line parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XsZgaXVB9SDRHMcbxxsp6J7gXf4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gygabyte_GEFORCE_RTX_06-9155c02250094bd1b2655f035149ab8e.jpg"                      alt="iBUYPOWER Custom Gaming Computer"                ></p><p>Alice Newcome-Beill &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="iBuypower-vs-Dell-Alienware-Aurora-R11"><a href="#iBuypower-vs-Dell-Alienware-Aurora-R11" class="headerlink" title="iBuypower vs. Dell Alienware Aurora R11"></a>iBuypower vs. Dell Alienware Aurora R11</h2><p> For comparison, I’m stacking this build up against one of our top picks for gaming PCs, the Dell Alienware R11. The R11, costs about $1,000 less, and you likely won’t need several weeks of lead time to have your system shipped, and you can typically buy multiple models right off the shelf. Perhaps more importantly, Alienware has updated the GPUs on all its current configurations to include Nvidia 30-series GPUs. So if that’s all you’re after, an Alienware R11 configuration likely represents a smarter investment.</p><p> However, Dell can’t offer the same variety of components that iBuypower has access to, and even the most exorbitant system from Alienware can’t hold a candle to the iBuypower and offers little challenge to their higher-end configurations in terms of performance.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r11-review-5075589" >Alienware Aurora R11 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A powerful custom-built gaming PC with a few clicks of a mouse.</strong></p><p> While many configurations from iBuypower are going to cost slightly more than other pre-fab PCs, they still offer an excellent value especially once you factor in labor and warranty. If you’re buying a one-off PC that you’re planning to upgrade down the line, iBuypower is easily one of your best options unless you’re really looking to pinch pennies, or you need several off the shelf PCs delivered quickly, in which case you may be better served by a pre-fab option from Alienware or CLX.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Custom Gaming PC</li><li>Product Brand  iBuypower</li><li>Price  $4,562.00</li><li>Color  Matte Black</li><li>Warranty  3 years</li><li>Case  NZXT H710 Tempered Glass Gaming Case</li><li>Case Fans  Corsair ML120 PRO Premium Magnetic Levitation 120mm Fan</li><li>Case Lighting  2 RGB LED Lighting Strips and Digital Fan Controller</li><li>Processor  AMD Ryzen 9 5900X Processor</li><li>Processor Cooling  NZXT Kraken Z73 360mm Liquid Cooling System w&#x2F; LCD Display</li><li>Video Card  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090</li><li>Motherboard  Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master</li><li>Power Supply  NZXT 850W C850 Fully Modular (850 Watt)</li><li>Number of USB 3.2 Ports  1 Type-C, 5 Type-A</li><li>Memory  8 GB</li><li>Video Card Memory  24GB</li><li>WiFi  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/marvels-avengers-striking-a-note-between-greatness-and-mundanity/"><u>'Marvel's Avengers': Striking a Note Between Greatness and Mundanity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-essential-first-steps-for-mastering-insta-chat-rooms/"><u>[New] Essential First Steps for Mastering Insta Chat Rooms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-leading-tools-to-personalize-and-enhance-your-speech-on-the-go-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leading Tools to Personalize and Enhance Your Speech on the Go for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-channel-studio-upgrade-vs-beta-shift/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Channel  Studio Upgrade Vs.

These skins are usually designed by a player and uploaded to a website for people to download and enjoy. They can also be designed specifically for the person who created it. In the Pocket, Console, and Windows 10 Editions of the game, however, Mojang has been known to get their hands dirty in terms of creating their own skins and releasing them for all of their audiences to enjoy. In this article, we will be discussing MInecraft’s “<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/" >Campfire Tales <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “ skin pack. Let’s talk about this.</p><h2 id="Halloween"><a href="#Halloween" class="headerlink" title="Halloween"></a>Halloween</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6eBth_cNXyUbw7QNSSRjRVSyMg8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/MC_Campfire_Tales_Blog_1024x576-58058f245f9b5805c27e632c.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> When Halloween comes around, these skins will definitely tickle your fancy in the area of spookiness. As the “Campfire Tales” skin pack is catered to the idea that the name suggests, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that these skins were designed to bring a new realm of creativity to the player, allowing them to make their own stories in-game or within their imagination. Each skin supposedly has its own story, with Mojang sharing a few of them in their recent post mentioning their existence. These various stories have been noted in the form of poems, with Ol’ Diggy’s and The Sea-Swallowed Captain’s being released.</p><p> Ol’ Diggy’s story has been noted as, “In mines and lonely caverns deep, you sometimes hear the sound: The tunk-tunk-tunk- of Diggy’s pick still prying at the ground. But light a torch and no one’s there, just shadows on the wall - No glimpse of Diggy’s greedy shade, still searching for his haul.”</p><p> The Sea-Swallowed Captain’s story was released stating, “Upon the black and wicked sea, The Captain did once sail, until it called her to its depths with lightning, wind, and hail. Some say she stalks the salt-stained shores, a briney, weed-wrapped wight, seeking young folk to join her crew, down in eternal night.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sixteen-Skins"><a href="#Sixteen-Skins" class="headerlink" title="Sixteen Skins"></a>Sixteen Skins</h2><p> In the “Minecraft: Campfire Tales” skin pack, players can assure themselves that they will have a very large diversity in terms of appearances they can use within the game. Sixteen skins are included within the pack for players to use at their leisure. The diversity included in this pack is enough to keep a player consistently going back and wondering if he or she should change their skin or not. I feel that factor as a whole is a huge point in why this skin pack is great.</p><p> While some of these skins may appear “normal” at first, dedicated players will notice their interesting characteristics. On the PC edition of the game (the regular, not Windows 10 Edition), players are limited in terms of what “sticks out” on a skin. A while back, ​<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/" >Mojang <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> added the support for an extra layer to be added on to certain areas of the “Minecraft” character’s body. These new skins, however, are completely “new” models. While the models interact with the environment like any other model, their appearances are more altered. Some skins like “The Sea-Swallowed Captain” feature a hat extending out multiple pixels past the original length, all the while also featuring interesting tidbits like a skinnier leg to be perceived as a peg-leg.</p><p> These various additions bring a new level of artistic vision to what was originally viewed as normal for design in terms of skins for players. While we, the players, are not able to create our own skins in this new “model” nature, we can enjoy the freedom of knowing there are plenty of skins with these specific concepts of design implemented.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#The-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="The Pros and Cons"></a>The Pros and Cons</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6T6cL28OPsm_1U5VPkd6PBwgMIE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/headless-haunter-580590743df78cbc2843ddb2.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> There are two sides to every coin and everybody prefers one. Someone might save that coin, while another person may spend it as soon as they get the chance. Sadly, this is where that coin comes into play. If you’ve played “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-minecraft-2363311" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “ since its original release, you may wonder why a person would pay money for skins. If you’ve recently joined in on the craze, you’d probably wonder how a person doesn’t. For players of the PC (non-Windows 10) Edition of the game, you may look at these skins as a quick cash grab by Mojang and Microsoft, while players who originally started playing on the other editions of the game may look at this as the regular.</p><p> Players are allowed to upload their own skins to the Pocket Edition and Windows 10 Edition of the game, however, they are not able to use the skins from the various packs available. When uploading your own skin to Pocket or Windows 10 Edition, you are stuck with the original look of the PC “Minecraft” skins, unable to have added in features like the “Farlander” skin. While these “features” do nothing to aid the player and are purely cosmetic, some people find these cosmetic overrides to be worth it.</p><p> Whoever purchases these skins gets the option to wear sixteen different costumes throughout their “Minecraft” adventure. Whether or not you want to shell out that much money, design your own, or use one of the pre-created skins that are available to use in the game, that is up to you.</p><p> Aside from the cost of the skin being the one negative, there are loads of positives. The designs are wonderful and fit with the Halloween season, the price isn’t as high as it honestly could be, and the diversity of characters are sure to make you learn everything about their appearance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Personal-Preference"><a href="#Personal-Preference" class="headerlink" title="Personal Preference"></a>Personal Preference</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kTjWZONU4iWrxUPn3I5oAzkumkE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/farlander-5805908a3df78cbc2843de47.png"                      alt="Minecraft Skins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> In my honest opinion, what makes this skin pack worth the small charge is a very select few of the skins within. The Farlander skin, the Rancid Anne skin, and The Sea-Swallowed Captain skin are easily my favorites out of the bunch of sixteen. These four skins are enough for me to purchase and use throughout my adventure in “Minecraft’s” Windows 10 Edition or the “Pocket Edition” game.</p><p> The Farlander skin has a very intriguing appearance with the floating blocks around its body. With its vague features, yet human appearance, players can either interpret this skin as either a boy or a girl. While players shouldn’t feel constricted to stick with a skin that looks like it is specifically one gender or the other, the fact that the Farlanders skin could be examined and interpreted as either is a nice touch (intentional or not).</p><p> While she’s definitely not a Raggedy Anne, she sure does smell bad. Rancid Anne 403 has a zombie-ish appearance, clearly depicted in mid-transformation. Mojang took it upon themselves to take advantage of the new models to push a zombified skin inside the original, allowing them to give a zombified appearance when removing a few pixels from the main “Anne” body parts.</p><p> Cropsy’s skin is of a very interesting design. While it may appear to be just a regular scarecrow, it’s actually alive! This skin dons a watermelon, rather than featuring the traditional pumpkin you would find on any other scarecrow’s head. On top of that, utilizing the new models, Mojang also placed a bright purple hat on his head, along with what appears to be a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-mobs-explained-villagers-2363338" >Villager’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nose that has been colored green. This addition makes him much more lively, especially with the haunting face that has been cut out.</p><p> The Sea-Swallowed Captain makes his very blue debut in this skin pack, showcasing many of his interesting features. With his hook for a hand, a peg leg, his missing teeth, a pirate hat, and his deep blue skin, it’d be very hard to miss him in a crowd. Out of the bunch, his skin is arguably the most detailed. The colors, layers, carefully detailed body parts, and outright originality used to create this character bring many new possibilities for designing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-mobs-explained-creepers-2363323" >mobs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and entities for “Minecraft.”</p><p> While there are other honorable mentions that were very close to making it to my top four skins within this pack, these are the ones I felt deserved the most recognition out of the bunch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="In-Conclusion"><a href="#In-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In Conclusion"></a>In Conclusion</h2><p> Whether or not you’d like to pay approximately a small charge on a handful of skins is your prerogative. If you feel you can better create or find a design for free online, you should honestly probably try to. While a small charge may not seem like a lot, it’s still money that you could spend on something else given the opportunity. You may purchase this pack of skins, think you want to use one, and never look at them again.</p><p> Think about it and decide later.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop.
