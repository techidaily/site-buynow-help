This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience.

I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete.

New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship.

I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure. Wildlife and farm animals are both present in this world, adding vibrancy to the countryside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YazM4IIiw6qfR_cd-AfR8Cek9pg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-10-b813058de14c4b92978d22f84715ab98.jpg"                      alt="AC Mountain"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Performance: A rough start"></a><strong>Setup Process and Performance: A rough start</strong></h2><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is typical of modern AAA titles in that it requires a big download and a considerable amount of storage space to house on your PC or console. With the day one update to consider, you’re looking at around 50GB.</p><p> Now, keep in mind that these are my pre-launch experiences with the game not fully patched. I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware. If you are playing on PC, be sure to utilize the benchmarking tool to find the ideal settings for your system.</p><p> Of course, if you’re playing on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you don’t have to worry about performance issues since the game is better optimized. It’s currently available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and will be available for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 at launch. You can also get it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Price-Typical-AAA"><a href="#Price-Typical-AAA" class="headerlink" title="Price: Typical AAA"></a><strong>Price: Typical AAA</strong></h2><p> The base game will set you back the typical $60, while the gold edition bundles in the season pass and costs a full $100. That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale. Just beware if you’re playing on a PC that will test the limits of your gaming rig.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (PC)</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg)<p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple users, multi-in multi-out) and beamforming capabilities, promising expanded range of up to 2,500 square feet and support for 30+ simultaneous devices.</p><p> If you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi mesh system instead.</p><h2 id="Price-More-than-most"><a href="#Price-More-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Price: More than most"></a><strong>Price: More than most</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is listed at $250, although it’s being sold for $220 at multiple retailers as of this writing. That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.

We spent a week with the Chromebook Flip to see how it compares to today’s competition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3Q2pRvweVt3Gf6RfBaAwQ15QBag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bottom_04-1508a99e93e94312a9477c6ec5c15022.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice"><a href="#Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice"></a><strong>Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice</strong></h2><p> Just as Chromebooks are conceptually designed as budget laptops, the Asus Chromebook Flip is physically built like a budget MacBook. It has the same kind of minimal aesthetic, albeit not to quite the same level of premium visual polish. From the hinge design to the materials and tiny nuances, the Chromebook Flip doesn’t look like a $1,000 laptop.</p><p> That’s not a complaint, just an observation. With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap. It feels like it’s built to deal with the daily stress of usage, but at a weight of just 2.65 pounds, it’s very light and easy to carry around. It does seem to attract dirt and smudges more than a lot of other aluminum laptops we’ve used, although it’s not difficult to rub them away.</p><p> The 12.5-inch touchscreen is a smidge smaller than the common 13-inch laptop screen size, but due to a lot of bezel around the display, the laptop’s overall size is nearly identical to an Apple MacBook Pro (albeit a little thicker). The excessive bezel and large Asus logo do signal the less high-end experience, however.</p><p> With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap.</p><p> Of course, as the name suggests, the Chromebook Flip does something that no MacBook can: it’s convertible, allowing you to fold the screen all the way back into a tablet form, or use a tent-like design to prop the device up and watch videos. The hinge feels sturdy in any position, thankfully, so you don’t have to worry about the tent falling flat, or the screen flopping around in any mode.</p><p> We’ve been using the Chromebook Flip in the tent mode to watch Twitch streams or YouTube playlists while washing dishes or making dinner, or having it run in the corner of a desk while doing other work. It’s super handy to have around as a portable, self-standing streaming display. And in the tablet format, with the screen fully folded back, it’s totally useful. It feels a bit odd to press your fingers against the keys while holding it, but don’t worry: they’re disabled in that form.</p><p> Like current MacBooks, the Chromebook Flip is all about USB-C ports; it puts one on each side and skips full-sized USB-A ports entirely. You can charge the laptop from either of those ports, and that versatility is appreciated. However, there’s also a microSD card port on the right, which is handy as the 64GB internal storage on this model is pretty slim (there are 32GB and 128GB versions available, as well), along with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left side.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard feels great in action. The one-piece chiclet keyboard has a scissor-style key design with 1.4mm of travel, which gives it a more satisfying feel than the latest MacBooks’ keys (which have very little travel), and the keys are responsive and not especially loud in usage. It’s also brightly backlit, which isn’t always the case with Chromebooks. The touchpad below is nicely sized and wider than some we’ve seen, although not nearly as large as Apple’s luxurious trackpads of late.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever"></a><strong>Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever</strong></h2><p> Setting up a Chromebook is incredibly easy. Just power it on (the button is on the left side), connect to a network, accept the terms of service and choose from any options that you’re prompted to, and then plug in your Google account info. If you do already have a Google account, then any bookmarks, Chrome extensions, and apps will automatically be added. If you don’t have a Google account, then you’ll need to sign up for one to use the Chromebook. In any case, this whole process shouldn’t take more than a matter of minutes to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AFQh-ERthm-g0pAMcnQlyA2Rjgw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bent_02-3dfd0720309d4d12beb5ae695a007aa1.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Small-but-strong"><a href="#Display-Small-but-strong" class="headerlink" title="Display: Small, but strong"></a><strong>Display: Small, but strong</strong></h2><p> As mentioned, the Chromebook Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1080p screen is a little smaller than you’ll see on some rivals, but that doesn’t take away from its usability. It’s colorful and nicely vibrant, and text and graphics typically look crisp. It’s not one of the brightest screens we’ve seen, with a listed brightness of about 300 nits, but that’s pretty common amongst laptops. It’s a little dimmer than we’d like, admittedly. Visibility is impacted in direct sunlight, but in most situations, it’s hard to complain too much about this screen.</p><p> It also acts like an extra-large tablet screen since it’s a touchscreen with 10 points of interaction. It felt just as responsive as any tablet we’ve used.</p><h2 id="Performance-It-does-what-it-can"><a href="#Performance-It-does-what-it-can" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It does what it can"></a><strong>Performance: It does what it can</strong></h2><p> You really can’t pit the Chromebook Flip against pricier Windows and Mac laptops in terms of sheer processing power because Chromebooks aren’t built to be beasts. But they don’t really need to be: the highest quality of graphics processing it’ll need to handle are mobile-quality games, since the Chromebook Flip can run Android apps from the Play Store, and you’re not able to download high-end games from Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p> The version of the Chromebook Flip we tested came with a 2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30 chip, although you can get versions with a Core M7 or Pentium 4405Y chip for more power. Paired with 4GB RAM, we found the device to be plenty speedy getting around Chrome OS.</p><p> Compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p> Given the access to the Play Store, we benchmarked the Chromebook Flip using the same tests we use for Android phones, with a score of 8,818 on the PCMark 2.0 Work test. The Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated graphics, meanwhile, delivered a frame rate of 12 frames per second in the Car Chase demo and 53 frames per second in the T-Rex demo. Essentially, the Chromebook Flip seems comparable to an upper mid-range Android phone.</p><p> That comparison held up when playing Android racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, which ran at a pretty smooth clip but definitely looked fuzzier than usual thanks to being blown up for the larger screen. Online battle royale shooter PUBG Mobile also ran solidly, although the keyboard and trackpad combination didn’t feel right. We folded the screen back entirely and just used the touchscreen, which worked fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7B1-43v0GHPcS2HESabWT97_XPQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_Keyboard_03-8bc37c7c2d0243bb8ed1fa10e338374f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Audio-Sounds-fine"><a href="#Audio-Sounds-fine" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Sounds fine"></a><strong>Audio: Sounds fine</strong></h2><p> The tiny speaker grates on the left and right side of the Chromebook Flip don’t look too promising, but the playback quality was better than expected. Music output isn’t big and bold, but it’s pretty clear and it can get loud without getting too muddled. Video playback via YouTube and Netflix was sometimes too quiet at full volume, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-No-complaints-here"><a href="#Network-No-complaints-here" class="headerlink" title="Network: No complaints here"></a><strong>Network: No complaints here</strong></h2><p> The Chromebook Flip has dual-band Wi-Fi that can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks, and we had no issues with either during our testing. We went online at a home network and a Starbucks Google network alike, and things were routinely speedy. On the home network, we saw speeds of about 33Mbps and upload speeds in excess of 10Mbps—essentially the same as we’ve seen with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >other laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth"><a href="#Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nearly a day’s worth"></a><strong>Battery: Nearly a day’s worth</strong></h2><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life. The 39Wh battery cell is rated for up to 10 hours, and while that estimate is ambitious for everyday use, we typically saw seven or more hours of mixed usage with the screen at full brightness. That’s for our usual workflow of surfing the web, typing out documents, watching some YouTube videos, and streaming music from Spotify.</p><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life.</p><p> Our laptop video rundown test, which streams a Netflix movie over Wi-Fi while at 100 percent brightness, delivered a similar result: it lasted 6 hours, 57 minutes before the Chromebook Flip shut down. In both use cases, we were pleasantly surprised by the battery performance of the device—it even beat the 2018 MacBook Air.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VR5Y-1tDILHowNSeA408pnLVtgg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_closed_04-bde5ec8f988c4bb49e4019f95cc47c31.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-It’s-definitely-different"><a href="#Software-It’s-definitely-different" class="headerlink" title="Software: It’s definitely different"></a><strong>Software: It’s definitely different</strong></h2><p> ChromeOS delivers an experience that’s halfway between a desktop PC and an Android tablet. It’s a much simpler approach to PC usage, focusing only on essential features and functionality. The interface has a PC-like bar at the bottom, but it’s really more like an app dock on your phone or tablet. Unsurprisingly, the experience is built around Google’s own apps, coming preloaded with the Chrome web browser, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Maps, and more.</p><p> Since the Chromebook Flip’s original release, Google has added the ability to run Android apps downloaded from the Play Store. This is the same Play Store found on scads of smartphones and tablets the world over, offering access to a wide array of games and apps. Not every app looks or acts perfectly on a larger screen, but we mostly had success: business chat app Slack looked like the desktop version on PC and Mac, as did Spotify. Twitch’s interface just looked like it was stretched out from the phone app, but video still played perfectly.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department.</p><p> Anyone looking for a familiar PC or Mac experience, or a device that can run familiar PC and Mac apps and games, might struggle with using a Chromebook. It’s really meant for casual usage—things like web browsing, watching media, writing, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >lightweight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> game playing. Need a device primed for high-end, professional creative software? Need something capable of playing the latest and greatest games? That’s not a Chromebook.</p><p> Luckily, the Chromebook’s reputation as an online-only device isn’t true. For example, Google Docs can be used offline, you can view and edit photos, watch locally-stored media, and play games that don’t require an online connection. It’s really not that different in approach to other PCs, but the overall feel and flow of the experience varies in some key ways.</p><h2 id="Price-It-feels-like-a-steal"><a href="#Price-It-feels-like-a-steal" class="headerlink" title="Price: It feels like a steal"></a><strong>Price: It feels like a steal</strong></h2><p> Here’s where the Asus Chromebook Flip really makes its biggest impact. As mentioned, it’s a capable computer for most everyday tasks, it has a very good screen, and the battery life is stellar. Best of all, it’s priced at $499, although you can find it for a little bit less (we’re seeing it around $400-450 lately). There are cheaper Chromebooks out there that skimp on features and functionality, such as skipping the convertible hinge or touch functionality, or using a lower-end processor. You can spend a lot less and still get a solid laptop.</p><p> But the Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department—and compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

At $1,099 or more, the MacBook Air is one of the most polished and premium ultraportable laptops you can buy today. The perks are obvious: it has a sleek and refined build, the brighter and higher-resolution 13.3-inch display is gorgeous, and the touchpad is excellent. It also runs macOS, a more robust operating system that still manages to be easy to use.</p><p> However, if your computer needs are pretty basic—browsing the web, watching videos, and typing up documents and filling out spreadsheets—then you don’t need a higher-end computer. And the Chromebook Flip has better battery life than the MacBook Air while delivering comparable functionality in many key ways. No doubt, the MacBook Air is the higher-quality option, but at $600 more, we’re not sure it’s worth it for most users.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-air-2018-review-4779750" >Apple MacBook Air (2018) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It’s an excellent, affordable laptop.</strong></p><p> Just as the recent crop of cheap, strong mid-range phones has made many flagship smartphones seem excessive and unnecessary, the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA does much the same for laptops.

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.devart.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=5023555&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/45b430710ad04765a6afd58d9d9fafca/products/dotConnect_O.png"                      border="0"                >dotConnect for Oracle is an ADO.NET data provider for Oracle with Entity Framework Support.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp; Internet Functionality  Internet video playback, WEB browsing</li><li>Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, LAN, Wi-Fi</li><li>Bluetooth Version  Bluetooth 5.0</li><li>Platform  LG ThinQ AI, webOS</li><li>Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Screen Size  65 inches</li><li>Type  OLED</li><li>Refresh Rate  120 Hz</li><li>Display Format  4k UHD (2160p)</li><li>HDR Technology  4K Cinema HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG)</li><li>Ports  4 HDMI 2.1 Ports, 3 USB Ports</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos 2.2 Channel 40 Watts</li><li>Additional Audio Features  Bluetooth audio streaming, Intelligent Voice Recognition, LG Sound Sync</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts. You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><p> You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><h2 id="Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector"><a href="#Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector" class="headerlink" title="Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector"></a><strong>Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector</strong></h2><p> A popular competitor brand to Escort that makes a wide selection of radar detectors is Uniden. The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

You could always stick with the classics like Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), but what if you want something that can fully take advantage of your new gaming rig or high-end graphics card?</p><p> This is where Laminar Research comes in with their next-gen X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator—a modern take on flight sims built for more<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >current hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that. Read our review below to see how the latest X-Plane release stacks up against classics like FSX.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KBuJiu3GVH9R41cibSGIkcK_7hs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_04-9dedb800bd1340e19901349ee3ca3bda.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist"><a href="#Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Preflight checklist"></a><strong>Setup Process: Preflight checklist</strong></h2><p> Currently, the game is available to be purchased from a number of online retailers in either disc or digital download format. We opted to go the old-school route and purchased the game in a pack of discs, so we’ll cover this option, but if you want to grab the software online, the steps are mostly the same (even simpler).</p><p> With the complete disc booklet in hand, your first order of business will be to make sure you’ve got the space. We did mention that X-Plane 11 sports some stunning visuals, and that means lots of space is needed to store all those details. The game requires a whopping 60GB of free space, so hopefully, you’ve got some extra room on your drive.</p><p> Begin by placing the first disc into your internal or external DVD drive. The installer will start automatically and it’s easy to follow the on-screen prompts. You’ll need to swap out the discs one after the other as the instructions indicate until you complete the setup.</p><p> While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that.</p><p> Once your software is fully set up, you can now launch the game and get yourself flying. Be sure to adjust the settings in the menu to your specific setup for things like resolution, quality, controls, etc.</p><p> Aside from setting up your game, it’s a good idea to connect your HOTAS during the initial setup. A HOTAS, or “hands-on throttle-and-stick,” is a set of peripherals that allow you to control your in-game aircraft with more realistic inputs. Combining one of these with X-Plane 11 will increase the immersion considerably.</p><p> There are a number of these to choose from, but we went with the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS which includes the added pedals. This unit is one of the more popular, affordable options, so we’ll briefly discuss how to set it up. Beginning with the obvious, connect all the cables to your computer’s USB ports. Don’t forget to connect the pedals to the throttle with the included cable.</p><p> Once you’ve got it hooked up, Windows should recognize the device and download the necessary drivers. When those have completed installing, you should be able to see the HOTAS connected in X-Plane 11 under the control settings. You’ll also be able to fine-tune things based on your preference from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O9MXEQGpCTKXA5qNcF6nXai8L2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_03-90ad9c4205af48bcbd8fcc163c630a5a.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home"><a href="#Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home"></a><strong>Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home</strong></h2><p> Booting up X-Plane 11, you’re greeted with a host of available options to choose from before your flight. While not nearly as deep as FSX, there are a lot of things you can pick between. If you’re just getting started, the Flight School will teach you the basics of flight in the game and allow you to get acclimated. If you’re not a newcomer, however, you can jump straight into the plane and environment of your choosing.</p><p> X-Plane 11 allows you to choose from a limited range of aircraft like basic prop planes to huge jumbo jets (though you can purchase more in the form of DLC). For environments, there are lots of major airports and cities to pick, and you can either select custom weather effects or go with real-world conditions updated in real-time. These options allow for a good bit of diversity, but there aren’t a ton of cool custom missions aimed at simply having fun as you’d see in FSX (no landing planes on moving buses here). The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Users also have the ability to fine-tune their aircraft’s specs, with options for weight, fuel level and more, allowing for some interesting setups. The menus in X-Plane 11 have been more streamlined overall versus previous installations of the series, which is a welcome addition. That said, they can quickly become too complex for basic users.</p><p> The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Jumping into a session, the gameplay feels solid, with tons of immersion and a fully clickable cockpit for each plane. You can choose to make these as complicated as you like, but the realism here is top-notch. Taxing your small Cessna across the airport of Hong Kong with the bright lights of the city all around you at night, and taking off into the sky feels awesome—about as close as you can get to flying a plane in your house.</p><p> While testing out X-Plane 11, we did experience some issues, but more so in the graphics department than the gameplay itself, which we’ll touch on in the next section.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GF7rAjDnQ1m4Lngb7N3ShcMRA6U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_05-4039c04a1e16492e8b1c6024167e28f8.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization"><a href="#Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization"></a><strong>Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization</strong></h2><p> With such a monster storage requirement, it’s no surprise that the details and graphics in X-Plane 11 are pretty remarkable. Planes themselves are the focus here, so the textures are superb. Also because Laminar chose to focus on fewer aircraft overall, the ones they’ve included all feel exceptionally well fleshed out. That tradeoff might not appeal to those who want hundreds of vehicles to select from, but it does make the selection in the game quite impressive.</p><p> Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> Aside from the planes themselves, the environments you pick from feel great, with realistic cities properly laid out to their real-world counterparts. Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> The skybox is an important one for flight simulators, and while X-Plane 11 improves over predecessors, it isn’t the best either. Clouds themselves are a particular eyesore, even with the settings turned up. Weather, on the other hand, looks splendid, with rain creating streaks on your windows and falling all around in spectacular fashion.</p><p> Another particularly bad graphical element is the trees. They’re one-dimensional and stick out in an otherwise beautiful environment. This is a bit of a disappointment, but isn’t a huge issue when you’re up in the air away from them.</p><p> One of the highlights of the visuals in X-Plane is the lighting. It’s high-quality and realistic, creating some incredible moments depending on your environment. Night flights are especially beautiful in the game, which has long been a favorite among fans of the franchise.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue is the optimization. It’s not very good, which can lead to some frustrating experiences. Even running on our PC with a high-end graphics card and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150" >CPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we had some instances of stuttering and frame drops (though nothing horrid). While turning down the settings can remedy this somewhat, the setup we were using shouldn’t have an issue and is a clear indication of poor optimization. For lower-end users or those looking to run the game off integrated graphics, you’ll likely have a crippling experience in performance, even when the graphics are low. The RAM requirements are also quite high, recommending 16GB, which puts it on par with AAA games.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue overall with the game is the optimization. It’s not very good and can lead to some frustrating experiences.</p><p> Lastly, we do recommend running the game on an SSD if you can, as HDDs are known to create annoying pop-ins while loading landscapes during flights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vw51Z13aohls1Ebaej2J6l1z-0E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_02-ae4e2d16b4db412aaa3e933fd3dfc7ab.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included"><a href="#Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included" class="headerlink" title="Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included"></a><strong>Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included</strong></h2><p> Because X-Plane 11 is a relatively newer game, the price is what you’d expect from most current AAA titles. The game is currently priced at about $60-70 depending on where you purchase it, so it’s not exactly cheap, but it is average for the market.</p><p> The biggest issue is that the X-Plane, like most other simulators, has an endless list of DLC that can quickly add up if you want to get everything possible in the package. While these aren’t necessary to enjoy the game by any means, they will add replayability and offer additional experiences if you’re willing to stomach the costs.</p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can currently purchase.</p><p> One nice feature with X-Plane is that you do have the option to install mods. These free packs of user-generated content can really spice things up by providing custom aircraft and environments if you’re looking to add content without adding more money. They aren’t as numerous as the mod options for FSX, but they’re there if you want them.</p><h2 id="X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X"><a href="#X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X" class="headerlink" title="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X"></a><strong>X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X</strong></h2><p> Comparing a classic staple in flight simulators like FSX to a more modern one like X-Plane 11 might feel a bit strange, but these two games are the most popular around even today. Given that FSX is about a decade older than X-Plane 11, you’ll need to understand that there are some big differences in terms of modernization between the two.</p><p> Despite its age, FSX is still a very capable sim, offering an unmatched amount of content, DLC, and mods to users looking for the absolute content. There’s something to be said for a game as old as FSX that’s still getting support and love from the fanbase. Even X-Plane 11 can’t hold a torch to the amount of replayability FSX offers.</p><p> However, X-Plane 11_is_ more modern, and that means you get a host of improvements over older simulators. The graphics will look much improved, environments are more current, the support will likely be better in years to come, and the gameplay feels tighter due to the vast advancements in tech. X-Plane 11 offers a next-gen experience that FSX will never come close to.</p><p> If your primary deciding factor is visuals, X-Plane is your go-to. If you want more content, well FSX is unmatched in that department. The price is also a bit better with FSX, but each of these titles will quickly add up if you want to get all the DLC available.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-gold-edition-review-4776936" >Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The best current-gen flight simulator available now.</strong></p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can buy.

Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device.

This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is one of the most portable and convenient travel air compressors you can buy. Its intuitive design allows anyone to fill up a low tire easily. It also has additional safety features that allow you to be seen at night and, if necessary, signal that you’re in distress. And when you’re done with it, it’s easy to pack up and store. Tradeoffs for these benefits include a small<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD display <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a short air hose, but given its intended function, those are trivial concerns.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive"></a><strong>Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive</strong></h2><p> At just 7.5 inches wide, 2.5 inches tall and 6 inches long, this is the smallest, most compact portable tire inflator we tested. When it’s in its carrying case, it only weighs 2 pounds, 31 ounces. Even small children should be able to carry it. If you need a portable tire inflator but don’t have a lot of space, this pump is exactly what you want.</p><p> The control panel is as about as basic and simple as it gets. The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read the owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work.</p><p> The control panel’s 1.5-inch LCD is the smallest display we saw among the devices we tested, nevertheless, it’s perfectly readable in the sun and at night. It displays tire pressure in PSI (pound per square inch)I, BAR (atmospheric pressure), and Kpa (kilopascal). If you live in the United States, chances are that you’ll exclusively use PSI. But if you ever need to measure pressure in the metric system or SI (International System of Units), you’ll be glad you have the ability.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work. When you turn it on, it will pump air until the desired pressure is achieved and turn itself off. This is great because it means you don’t have to constantly monitor it to make sure you don’t overfill your tires.</p><p> Most portable tire inflators draw their power from a 12V adapter attached to the power cord. The SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is no different. Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately. This is a great convenience compared to pumps like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which requires you to hook it up to your car’s battery, jumper-cable style.</p><p> The built-in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is more useful than any of the portable tire compressors we tested. It not only illuminates the tire you’re inflating but also much of the surrounding area. Additionally, you can set the light to flash hazard signals so oncoming traffic can spot you better at night. It even has the ability to flash S.O.S. in morse code to signal a serious emergency that you need immediate assistance with.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management. The air hose and power cord have separate compartments built into the pump’s housing, and they both fit snugly for easy storage. Another portable air compressor we tested, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator, has extremely awkward cord management that results in frustration and cables jutting out the side of the device when it’s not in use.</p><p> The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> The air-hose on this portable compressor is a scant 24 inches, which means that you have to be within two feet of the tire or object you’re inflating. This is fine if you only plan on using it for regular tire pressure maintenance and “just-in-case” scenarios. Fortunately, the 10-foot power cord provides enough range to reach every tire on your vehicle.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes</strong></h2><p> Jaco provides a brief, but informative user manual tucked in the carrying case. Despite how intuitive this pump is to use, you should take five minutes to read the whole thing. During testing, we timed how long it takes to get out of your driver’s seat, retrieve the pump from the trunk, connect it to power, attach it to an under-inflated tire, set the pressure and start the pump. On average, the whole process took about 1 minute, 30 seconds.</p><p> Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable across the highways of America"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable across the highways of America</strong></h2><p> In order to recreate the situations that you’re most likely to use a portable tire inflator, we took the models we tested on a long road trip through the states of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. When we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations along the way, we deflated the tires on our car to 20 PSI—the point where they are dangerously low to drive on.</p><p> We timed how long it took the Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator to re-inflate the tires to the recommended 32 PSI. On average, it took about 2 minutes, 13 seconds to fill the tires. This represents the slowest fill time of the portable air compressors we tested, while the fastest average we recorded was 55 seconds.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management.</p><p> We checked the accuracy of the pressure gauge by comparing its readings to that of a simple pencil-style gauge. Each time we took a reading, they matched within a 0.5 PSI range. That’s as about as close to perfect that you can expect.</p><p> Any air compressor is going to generate a lot of noise, so we used a sound meter to measure how loud this tire inflator gets while running. We recorded sound levels up to 97 decibels, but it was usually a steady 95 decibels. Although the sound is grating, you won’t have to wear protection unless you plan to have it continually running for hours.</p><p> That also shouldn’t be an issue because the pump automatically cycles down after 30 minutes of continuous use, and you’ll have to wait until it cools down to use it again. This shouldn’t be a problem, since you can conceivably fill all four of your car’s tires in under 10 minutes. You’d have to inflate something exceptionally large to run this pump for that long.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind</strong></h2><p> With a list price of $90, this is the most expensive portable tire inflator we tested, but it’s typically on sale for half the price. That makes it more reasonable, especially if you need a portable compressor but are really tight on space. Or if you want to ensure maximum safety and visibility at night. But it certainly isn’t a budget model like the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump.</p><p> It’s impossible to predict how long a product will last after just a few days or using it, however, the warranty period is a good indicator of the long-term durability. Jaco offers a lifetime warranty on this compressor, so it should last a really long time, or at least until you forget it’s still under warranty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Although the Kensun is about twice as large as the Jaco, they’re designed to do the same thing. For example, they both draw power from your car’s 12V socket, but if you want to get away from your car, the Kensun comes with an AC power cord that you can plug into a wall socket.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts.

The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Specs<ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 - F&#x2F;4</li><li>Focus  Manual Focus 8mm to infinity</li><li>Field of vision  34 degrees</li><li>Resolution  640 x 480; 12 MP claimed, 0.31 MP tested</li><li>Frame rate  30fps</li><li>What’s Included  Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The market for 17-inch laptops might not be massive, but the LG Gram 17 certainly makes a compelling argument in their favor. Traditionally the two largest drawbacks to 17-inch laptops are the physical footprint, and the weight, both of which make these large laptops less than portable. The LG Gram does away with both of these problems with its 2.95 pound body and thin bezels, packing a 17-inch screen in a 15-inch body.</p><p> LG further supports this laptop with a better than average suite of specs, including an 8th gen i7-8565 processor, 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM. This laptop unsurprisingly omits a discrete graphics card in its slender 0.7-inch thick frame, so don’t plan on doing any gaming or similarly heavy graphics work, but it should otherwise stand up to just about any task.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bPwgN393oESXdTRdBMHH9_o-50k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-4-65036fddfdad4e9c904b1e4388426085.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-A-thoughtful-approach-to-larger-laptops"><a href="#Design-A-thoughtful-approach-to-larger-laptops" class="headerlink" title="Design :A thoughtful approach to larger laptops"></a><strong>Design</strong> :<strong>A thoughtful approach to larger laptops</strong></h2><p> Without question, the first thing you will notice when you take the LG Gram 17 out of its box is how light it is. Weighing less than 3 pounds, it’s trivial to lift, hold, and carry with one hand. For reference, a current-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs in at just over 4 pounds, so it’s a funny feeling to hold a larger laptop that weighs less. There haven’t been any great miracles worked here—the reduced weight comes at the cost of a flimsier feeling construction that lacks the sturdiness of heavier laptops.</p><p> Despite the slim frame, the LG Gram 17 still manages a fair amount of connectivity. The left side of the device contains a USB-A, HDMI, and USB-C ports, while the right side houses two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader. This may not be an overabundance of connectivity options, but it’s more than we’ve come to expect from modern laptops.</p><p> The market for 17-inch laptops might not be massive, but the LG Gram 17 certainly makes a compelling argument in their favor.</p><p> The keyboard takes advantage of the sizeable frame and provides a full-size layout complete with numpad. The keys themselves are a bit on the mushier side, but after a bit of acclimation, we were able to type quickly enough to not be an issue. One peculiarity that might bothersome, however, is the placement of the touchpad square in the middle instead of aligned with the main key rows. This did cause us to accidentally move the cursor while typing on plenty of occasions.</p><p> Finally, the fingerprint sensor, located directly on the power button on the top right corner of the keyboard, performed fairly well in our tests. This placement, although precarious in theory, didn’t cause any mishaps during our testing. This placement is actually somewhat advantageous—if you turn on the laptop using a finger registered to the fingerprint sensor, it wakes straight into Windows seamlessly without even hitting the login prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NZFtzU5S2IX_YcC_7X7i2oB0j1o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-2-d528eacd17e849099026bd1df6142200.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-help-needed"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-help-needed" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :No help needed"></a><strong>Setup</strong> <strong>Process</strong> :<strong>No help needed</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 arrives in a minimally packaged box containing only the essentials: The laptop itself, the charger, a manual, and an adapter for the USB-C port. LG definitely gets high marks on setup, requiring minimal steps to get set up and begin using your device right away. You will be prompted to enter the standard information any Windows laptop will ask—like your Wi-Fi credentials, a username and password, your timezone, and if you’d like, a fingerprint impression.</p><p> Once you’ve completed setup, you’ll be introduced to the LG Update Center, designed to handle both Windows updates and updates to LG’s software on the laptop. Thankfully, this software is very discreet and hands-off, not overstepping its intended purpose. LG is very light on 3rd party software bundled with the laptop, containing only a handful of bespoke applications which we will cover in greater detail in the Software section. Suffice it to say, there is a lot less bloatware than we normally find on laptops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mt69Vhar3JM30uFdBWA58_wPdYg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-5-f2352e95cadc4e2b99d738b0238fb7bf.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Display-A-joy-to-use"><a href="#Display-A-joy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Display :A joy to use"></a><strong>Display</strong> :<strong>A joy to use</strong></h2><p> The large, bright 17-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display is definitely the centerpiece of the LG Gram 17. It strikes the perfect balance of size to resolution ratio. Having a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 definitely gives the feeling that you have more room to play around with.</p><p> We were impressed by how bright and vivid colors were on this display when watching video content. The IPS display is sharp, featuring attractive colors and satisfying contrast. Keep in mind though that while watching most standard 16:9 content, you aren’t taking advantage of all 17 inches of the display, and will see black bars on the top and bottom.</p><p> The large, bright 17-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display is definitely the centerpiece of the LG Gram 17.</p><p> Productivity is definitely where this laptop shines. The large, tall screen makes it really perfect for getting things done. It’s easy to throw a couple of applications side by side and have plenty of real estate to work with. Even if you don’t feel like you’re missing much on your current laptop, it’s definitely nice to be able to scroll less and see more at-a-glance.</p><p> The IPS display also performs admirably by most other metrics that buyers will care about, such as a maximum brightness high enough to be usable outdoors. Additionally, the display looks great from off-angles, losing very little brightness when viewed from the sides, and showing no signs of color shift.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Ready-to-work-but-not-to-game"><a href="#Performance-Ready-to-work-but-not-to-game" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Ready to work (but not to game)"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Ready to work (but not to game)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 performed well in our tests, managing a 3,851 score in PCMark 10. As mentioned previously, this laptop is best suited for productivity-related tasks. The absence of a dedicated graphics card means that it won’t be able to keep up in anything beyond casual games and very light video editing workloads, but so long as you avoid these types of tasks you shouldn’t really notice any shortcomings. The 16GB of RAM and 8th gen Intel i7 made using the Gram 17 a fast, responsive experience in everyday and work-related tasks.</p><p> We did nonetheless test the LG Gram 17 in some less demanding games, such as Slay the Spire, a roguelike card game with relatively undemanding graphics.

To make matters worse, these speakers are easily covered and muffled when it sits on your lap. Even when the stars aligned and we happened to leave the speakers unobstructed, we weren’t impressed by the sound offered. In short, get ready to use headphones or external speakers, and don’t plan on having any movie viewing parties with it either.</p><p> Keep in mind though that while watching most standard 16:9 content, you aren’t taking advantage of all 17 inches of the display, and will see black bars on the top and bottom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Everything-you’d-expect"><a href="#Network-Everything-you’d-expect" class="headerlink" title="Network :Everything you’d expect"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Everything you’d expect</strong></h2><p> Wi-Fi on the LG Gram 17 gave us no trouble, offering a strong signal and speeds in any of the public and private environments we tested in. LG uses the Intel Wireless AC 9560 Wi-Fi adapter, the fastest of such chips currently on offer from Intel. This Wi-Fi adapter has a theoretical max speed of 1.73Gbps and offers a 2x2 antenna configuration, though you’re unlikely to ever hit such a high download speed.</p><h2 id="Camera-Bare-minimum"><a href="#Camera-Bare-minimum" class="headerlink" title="Camera :Bare minimum"></a><strong>Camera</strong> :<strong>Bare minimum</strong></h2><p> The 720p webcam on the LG Gram 17 is nothing to write home about, and probably won’t be the platform you use for taking your next headshot or dating profile picture. The camera has a tendency to blow out the background in an attempt to keep the subject in focus, and there is a plainly visible amount of noise in the image even in generous daylight conditions.

In our tests, the laptop averaged around 14 hours during mixed daily use—still quite a great deal. This is likely due to a mixture of the larger than average battery, lack of a discrete graphics card, and an energy-efficient display. This is about as good as you can hope for in a laptop, to be honest, and a surprising achievement for such a light and thin one. If time between charges is a concern for you, take note.</p><p> When running Battery Eater Pro to push the laptop to its limits, it kicked the bucket in just over 2 hours and 30 minutes. This may seem like a very short time, but it’s still considerably better than any of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-17-inch-laptops-832683" >other 17-inch laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested using this brutal benchmark.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Standard-Windows-with-some-unique-features"><a href="#Software-Standard-Windows-with-some-unique-features" class="headerlink" title="Software: Standard Windows with some unique features"></a><strong>Software: Standard Windows with some unique features</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 comes with a fairly vanilla installation of Windows 10 Home, offering very little in the way of custom third party applications or other types of bloat. In our eyes, this is a big plus, as having numerous added applications can slow systems (and users) down, and often serve as yet another piece of software to keep up to date.</p><p> The three main pieces of software we did find pre-installed were the LG Update Center, LG Control Center, and Reader Mode. LG Update Center helps manage Windows updates in addition to driver updates, and does so without being overly complicated or intrusive.</p><p> As it stands, you won’t find a lighter, smaller 17-inch laptop than the LG Gram 17.</p><p> The LG Control Center gives users quick access to common system functions like power management, Windows security, and system settings. You can control the volume, disable the touchpad temporarily, manage screen and keyboard backlight brightness, and more. This might not be altogether_necessary_ , but users can simply not use it if they wish.</p><p> Finally, the LG Gram 17 comes with Reader Mode as a pre-installed app that runs in the background on startup and is accessible from the taskbar. Switching it on changes the color temperature of the display to filter out blue light (by default) and make night-time and low-light usage more pleasant. You can also take control of the adjustments that Reader Mode makes, controlling the brightness, contrast, and gamma adjustments for red, green, and blue independently. This seems excessive, but we can’t fault LG too much for giving users more control.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Lighter-laptop-bigger-price-tag"><a href="#Price-Lighter-laptop-bigger-price-tag" class="headerlink" title="Price: Lighter laptop, bigger price tag"></a><strong>Price: Lighter laptop, bigger price tag</strong></h2><p> At an MSRP of $1,700, the LG Gram 17 is not particularly affordable, and even less so when compared to similar options in the market. For this price, we would normally expect to get a discrete graphics card and the expanded possibilities that come with it. The premium you are paying for in this case isn’t sheer price-to-performance but portability and form factor. On these fronts, the LG Gram 17 definitely shines.</p><h2 id="LG-Gram-17-vs-ASUS-VivoBook-Pro-17"><a href="#LG-Gram-17-vs-ASUS-VivoBook-Pro-17" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 17 vs. ASUS VivoBook Pro 17"></a><strong>LG Gram 17 vs. ASUS VivoBook Pro 17</strong></h2><p> These two laptops share very little in common other than both having 17-inch displays and the same Intel processor. The VivoBook has a lower resolution (1920 x 1080 versus 2560 x 1600) display, larger bezels, chunkier body, smaller battery, and weighs over 50 percent more (4.6 versus 2.95 pounds). The VivoBook, on the other hand, has an Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics card and costs far less ($1,099 vs $1,699).</p><p> If form factor and portability are higher on your list, the LG probably still wins out, but where price-to-performance is concerned, the VivoBook Pro 17 wins handily.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-vivobook-pro-17-review-4775930" >Asus VivoBook Pro 17 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A featherweight champion for productivity.</strong></p><p> As it stands, you won’t find a lighter, smaller 17-inch laptop than the LG Gram 17. LG is aware of how valuable this is to buyers that care about these metrics, and has priced their laptop accordingly. If you are shopping for what the Gram has on offer, we can’t imagine you’ll be too disappointed. This is a smart, capable laptop that delights in daily use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Specs<ul><li>Product Name  Gram 17</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>MPN  B07MNDYX9Z</li><li>Price  $1,699.99</li><li>Release Date  December 2018</li><li>Weight  2.95 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 10.5 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-8565U @ 1.8 GHz</li><li>Graphics  Intel HD Graphics 610</li><li>Display  17 Inch WQXGA (2560 x 1600) resolution 16: 10 IPS display</li><li>Memory  16GB DDR4 2400MHz - 8 GB x 1 (On Board) - 8 GB x 1</li><li>Storage  512 GB SSD</li><li>Battery  4-cell, 72 Wh</li><li>Ports  3x USB 3.0 (A), 1 headphone&#x2F;microphone combo, 1x Thunderbolt 3 port, 1x HDMI, 1x microSD card reader</li><li>Warranty  1 Year Limited</li><li>Platform  Window 10 Home</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> A common misconception of Powerline kits like the Netgear Powerline 1200 is that they’re essentially Wi-Fi extender, but that’s an incorrect conception of it. Powerline kits “pick up” your established wired network from the router and transport it to another room, where Ethernet cables can then be attached to the device via the Powerline adapter. It solves the problem of games consoles,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and other devices which have poor Wi-Fi signal or efficiency.</p><p> The Netgear Powerline 1200 Kit serves as a chunky plug-in adapter that offers impressive speeds over wired Ethernet, at the cost of your power sockets. We put it to the test to see if it’s worth the price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pTY-hBlPDWY0Ns6j4BVyAl75U-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_Powerline1000_04-cd509045b4a3477fab85fdf3c69cacb4.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Powerline 1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Oloman</p><h2 id="Design-Sharp-edges-and-frustration"><a href="#Design-Sharp-edges-and-frustration" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sharp edges and frustration"></a><strong>Design: Sharp edges and frustration</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Powerline 1200 kit doesn’t really care about your living room or bedroom aesthetic. It’s a monolithic, white glossy plastic box that juts out of the wall. If you’re looking for something inoffensive and reserved, the Netgear offering doesn’t deliver. The edges are sharp and the adapter is quite large in order to house all of the technology and the Ethernet sockets necessary to complete the network.</p><p> It’s not as heavy as other Powerline products at 1.14 pounds, but there’s a big section of plastic hanging below. This is awful for obstruction, as it means that if you’re dealing with rows of plug sockets, you can no longer use the socket below the adapter. It’s also a difficult shape, especially if you’ve got limited plug points. Worse, you lose the functionality of the socket you plug the adapter into. Other products in the market have fixed this issue by adding a socket to the front so you can plug in other electronic devices.</p><p> The Netgear Powerline 1200 kit doesn’t really care about your living room or bedroom aesthetic. It’s a monolithic, white glossy plastic box that juts out of the wall.</p><p> The Ethernet ports are also found on the bottom of the device, which is awkward for installation, bu again impedes the space used by other plugs, which can be frustrating. It’s not a huge deal if you’re dealing with a single socket, but when you have to make sure that the Powerline is plugged right into the socket, it can become difficult if those options aren’t available to you in the room you want to expand your network to.</p><p> There’s also only one Ethernet port on the Netgear kit, which means that you can only improve the wired connection of one device—a poor payoff for all of the manoeuvering you may have to do, especially when there’s certainly space for another port. Overall, the design is obtrusive and frustrating, which is a shame given how reliable adapter is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LMrQEcpONDZxLUfoMW6U8sX4dQw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_Powerline1000_02-a8557f722ac84f29b6efb2a763d22a3c.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Powerline 1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Oloman</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Delightfully-quick-and-efficient"><a href="#Setup-Process-Delightfully-quick-and-efficient" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Delightfully quick and efficient"></a><strong>Setup Process: Delightfully quick and efficient</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Powerline 1200 is a dream to start, since all it takes is plugging the devices in for them to work. Simply place one near your router, attach the Ethernet cable, then head to the room where you want to expand the network and do the same there, attaching the Ethernet to a console, smart TV or electronic device with an internet connection.</p><p> You don’t even have to pair them together like other products on the market. It’s the kind of device where you ask yourself, “Is that it?” once it’s up and running and the answer is a confident yes. It takes very little time for the LED lights to tell you if your placement is correct, and we didn’t struggle to get things working even in a variety of rooms around my house. Just make sure to keep within the quoted 500-meter range.</p><p> You don’t even have to pair them together like other products on the market. It’s the kind of device where you ask yourself, “Is that it?” once it’s up and running and the answer is a confident yes.</p><p> If you’d like to go further than that, there’s also a security button which lets you change the encryption of the Powerline network you’ve created, and a handy Factory Reset button if mistakes are made, located on the bottom of the device. As long as the design doesn’t obstruct you, setup is simple and surprisingly speedy.</p><p> The only unfortunate thing to note is that the Ethernet cables supplied in the box are tiny, and will not stretch very far. We’d go so far as to say that you should purchase longer Ethernet cables in advance. It seems short-sighted to offer the promise of an expanded network without the cables that are long enough to enable it. We ended up swapping them out with some we had laying around the house.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LvSmrJJnFItVzQEAPCzBexfSn2M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_Powerline1000_03-8fb5af44f82449b49fc780fd23bcb2af.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Powerline 1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Oloman</p><h2 id="Performance-A-solid-improvement"><a href="#Performance-A-solid-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A solid improvement"></a><strong>Performance: A solid improvement</strong></h2><p> Using the device across our living room and bedroom, in two different setups across the course of a month, we found that the Netgear Powerline kit gave us a reliable upgrade to internet efficiency. Our initial connection speed (as per<a class="link"   href="https://www.speedtest.net/" >Speedtest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) offered a 68.4Mbps download speed, with 3.60Mbps upload speed, and sub-10-millisecond ping. The Netgear kit with an Ethernet cable attached to our laptop afforded us an 88Mbps download speeds and 6Mbps upload speeds.</p><p> With an upper limit of 1.2Gbps in download, the sky really is the limit with this adapter, and it can even be applied in a small business setting where the network is already very strong.</p><p> This is perfect if you work from home and want to be able to pick up from any location in the house, say the dining room or living room instead of your office. Even more important, it offers up speed that can handle 4K streaming. Speeds like those we got above will ensure that your living room or bedroom is not plagued by poor signal efficiency or haunted by devices with ancient Wi-Fi chips.</p><p> You can create a secure and powerful network that boasts a dramatic upgrade in efficacy, all for a low price point, with a setup process that is actually plug and play. It also has some energy-saving features built in to bring your costs down when you’re not using the network.

You can see why when you study the design and the many aesthetic flaws that come with this product. Besides the fact it is bulky and doesn’t play nice with other plugs, it’s a reliable means to improve your home network through the wonders of Powerline. It’s still quite a hard sell at this price compared to other products that hover around the same and offer more ports and socket functionality, but it’s still a worthwhile purchase if you just want to plug and play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Powerline-1200-vs-TP-Link-AV2000-Powerline-Adapter"><a href="#Netgear-Powerline-1200-vs-TP-Link-AV2000-Powerline-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Powerline 1200 vs. TP-Link AV2000 Powerline Adapter"></a><strong>Netgear Powerline 1200 vs. TP-Link AV2000 Powerline Adapter</strong></h2><p> Comparing the Netgear Powerline 1200 kit to the TP-Link Powerline AV2000, there are some noticeable pros and cons. The TP-Link kit performs better speed-wise, has serviceable cables, lets you use the socket and doesn’t obstruct other plugs. However, the setup process isn’t as simple and we found some easily-fixed, but frustrating issues with connectivity.</p><p> For a similar price, it’s hard not to recommend the TP-Link, especially when you’re going to receive Ethernet cables that you won’t have to replace due to router proximity. That’s not to say that the Netgear set isn’t reliable, and if it was on sale we would pick it up in a heartbeat. The main advantage the TP-Link has over the Netgear is the two Ethernet sockets on the outgoing device, which doubles the devices you can upgrade the internet speed with. This is crucial, and probably the deciding factor for many.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-av2000-powerline-adapter-review-4775701" >TP-Link AV2000 Powerline Adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A Powerline kit with solid speeds and an easy setup undermined by poor design.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Powerline 1200 is incredibly reliable, albeit poorly designed. It is obstructive in the design department, fairly ugly to look at and comes with just one connection and awfully short Ethernet cables. Yet it has a true plug and play setup process with no compromises, and offers a reliable upgrade to your home network speeds. If you can look past the strange design choices this is the perfect introductory kit for Powerline beginners that does everything you need it to.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Powerline PL1200</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>UPC  4R518CD6A0726</li><li>Price  $84.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  4.7 x 2.3 x 16 in.</li><li>Ports  Ethernet</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience. You can adjust the difficulty of stealth, combat, and exploration separately, so you can choose which gameplay elements are difficult and which you’d rather not get in the way. Additionally, mature elements in the game such as blood and gore can be toggled on and off, which will be a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-games-4147292" >relief to parents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a boon to anyone who doesn’t fancy seeing severed heads flying through the air.</p><h2 id="Minigames-Enjoyable-diversions"><a href="#Minigames-Enjoyable-diversions" class="headerlink" title="Minigames: Enjoyable diversions"></a><strong>Minigames: Enjoyable diversions</strong></h2><p> There’s more to do than fighting and exploring; in Valhalla there are a number of intriguing minigames to divert you from quests. I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete. After all, are you really a Viking warrior if you’re not completely drunk all the time?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/trRirIDsjFej03o-_HDCFsnnrzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-6-5449cde060b441a499a5189fda9a7a0a.jpg"                      alt="AC tattoos"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak"><a href="#Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak"></a><strong>Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak</strong></h2><p> As in Odyssey, the game allows you to play as either male or female, and offers a range of cosmetic options, mainly by way of tattoos and hairstyles. New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship. Eventually, you will also be able to customize the appearance of your settlement.</p><p> I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Epic-good-looks"><a href="#Graphics-Epic-good-looks" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Epic good looks"></a><strong>Graphics: Epic good looks</strong></h2><p> Valhalla is an absolutely gorgeous game. Everything from the detailed character models to the vibrant open world is beautiful to look upon. Changing weather alters the mood of landscapes, and can create breathtaking moments. I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure. Wildlife and farm animals are both present in this world, adding vibrancy to the countryside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YazM4IIiw6qfR_cd-AfR8Cek9pg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-10-b813058de14c4b92978d22f84715ab98.jpg"                      alt="AC Mountain"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Performance: A rough start"></a><strong>Setup Process and Performance: A rough start</strong></h2><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is typical of modern AAA titles in that it requires a big download and a considerable amount of storage space to house on your PC or console. With the day one update to consider, you’re looking at around 50GB.</p><p> Now, keep in mind that these are my pre-launch experiences with the game not fully patched. I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a><br><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/Affiliates_300x250px_valentinesday.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware. If you are playing on PC, be sure to utilize the benchmarking tool to find the ideal settings for your system.</p><p> Of course, if you’re playing on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you don’t have to worry about performance issues since the game is better optimized. It’s currently available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and will be available for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 at launch. You can also get it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Price-Typical-AAA"><a href="#Price-Typical-AAA" class="headerlink" title="Price: Typical AAA"></a><strong>Price: Typical AAA</strong></h2><p> The base game will set you back the typical $60, while the gold edition bundles in the season pass and costs a full $100. That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale.

Sitting outside and watching TV with friends and family. While there are some workarounds for getting standard TVs to work outside and staying somewhat protected from the elements, the reality is if you want a long-term solution, your best bet is to get a TV<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-outdoor-tvs-4154865" >made specifically for the outdoors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Outdoor TVs like the Sealoc Coastal Silver are designed to take on the elements without batting an eye and provide a great viewing experience in nearly any environment you can throw their way. In this review, I share my experience with<a class="link"   href="https://www.sealoctvs.com/" >Sealoc’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outdoor TV after spending more than 40 hours testing it over the course of two months throughout the ever-changing conditions of Michigan’s springtime.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-sleek"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-sleek" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and sleek"></a><strong>Design: Slim and sleek</strong></h2><p> Unlike other outdoor TV manufacturers, Sealoc doesn’t simply form a box around a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >standard TV, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> seal a few areas and call it a day. No, instead they opt to strip down the TV as it is and quite literally waterproof it from the inside out, resulting in an ultra-thin outdoor TV that you’d barely recognize was weather-sealed.</p><p> The front of the television remains largely unchanged from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >LG frame <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the TV is a modified version of. The bezels are thin and aside from protective seam tape around all sides of the television and a slim bead of clear sealant around the edge of the bezel to further protect it from the elements, it doesn’t look much different from the TV you probably have in your family room.</p><p> Compared to other outdoor TVs on the market, the Sealoc 55-inch Coastal Silver is slim and sleek, which not only creates a beautiful profile more akin to your average TV, but also makes for a much lighter piece of equipment.</p><p> Even on the back, there are only a few things that set it apart from your standard indoor TV. Most notably, the I&#x2F;O ports on the rear of the TV are covered by a water-resistant fabric that’s sealed at the top and secures to the back of the television on the three remaining sides via hook-and-loop tape that’s secured with additional screws. Sealoc has also modified the VESA mount on the rear of the TV, adding roughly two-inch lugs, which are sealed on the back of the television and help to provide extra distance from the wall the TV is mounted to.</p><p> Other smaller details you might notice include additional sealant on the upper vent of the television and a few extra strips of the seam tape around the various parts of the TV that could be entrance points for moisture.</p><p> Compared to other outdoor TVs on the market, the SkyVue Sealoc Coastal Silver is slim and sleek, which not only creates a beautiful profile more akin to your average TV, but also makes for a much lighter piece of equipment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8jle4bs6PXyy2Qzvq1c0IJW_V2E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_15_Horiz-f55f96dc584047a0b61f1e05f56976cc.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Durability-It-can-handle-it-all"><a href="#Durability-It-can-handle-it-all" class="headerlink" title="Durability: It can handle it all"></a><strong>Durability: It can handle it all</strong></h2><p> The 55-inch Coastal Silver TV is part of Sealoc’s full exposure weatherproof series, which means it’s designed to take on nearly anything you can throw at it. As mentioned above, Sealoc doesn’t just slap a weatherproof case around the TV inside and call it a day. Instead, Sealoc strips down the TV and waterproofs even the internal electronic components using a proprietary “nano-coating” that helps to shed moisture away in the event it somehow manages to make it past the other sealing elements.</p><p> Around the entire perimeter of the TV Sealoc uses a heavy-duty seam tape that blends in perfectly with the frame of the television and anywhere the seam tape can’t be used, Sealoc uses a clear sealant, with the aforementioned protective flap used to keep the various ports and connections safe from water.</p><p> In the roughly two months I tested this TV, our home in Michigan saw snow, rain, and even dime-sized hail at one point. Through it all, the 55-inch Coastal Silver TV stayed put, mounted to an external wall on our fully-exposed patio. And through it all, not a single scratch or blemish was found on the television.</p><p> To really put it to the test, I also sprayed it with the hose on various settings for minutes at a time, and even on the Jet setting, the TV kept kicking with no signs of internal moisture anywhere.</p><p> Overall, unless you’re exposing this unit to salty seawater day in, day out, in the harshest environments, I have a hard time seeing how this TV won’t hold up for years to come.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GJ1StKRMx12EggdPfSJWCSSS7aY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_02_Horiz-1df71300a60d421f848d96050a856fbe-d93884cf38ee40188089dc6d114570d3.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Not-much-to-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Not-much-to-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Not much to it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Not much to it</strong></h2><p> Getting started with the 55-inch Coastal Silver TV is more or less plug and play. Since it doesn’t come with a stand, you will need some sort of wall mount (this particular model uses 400x400mm VESA mounting points). I suggest getting a great outdoor-specific mount to prevent unwanted rust, but if you’re planning on keeping it in a more covered area, you might be able to get away with a standard wall mount.</p><p> Once mounted and plugged in, it’s simply a matter of plugging in your peripherals and turning the TV on. On the topic of peripherals, it’s important to note that unless you’re using a compact stick-style device—such as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213" >Google Chromecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-4691492" >Amazon Fire TV Stick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —you’ll want to find a way to run cables to another weatherproof location, as there isn’t any room on the TV itself to mount or hide the devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OnY0-xZAailZsOzbKDqy1Zy3Gaw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_03_Horiz-65682943818f4cb49f1fe614eaeb18e6.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Image-and-Audio-Quality-Fantastic-rain-or-shine"><a href="#Image-and-Audio-Quality-Fantastic-rain-or-shine" class="headerlink" title="Image and Audio Quality: Fantastic, rain or shine"></a><strong>Image and Audio Quality: Fantastic, rain or shine</strong></h2><p> While this particular TV is branded as a full-sun Sealoc unit, underneath the branding and weather-sealing it’s an LG 6-series 4K HDR TV that’s been custom calibrated by Sealoc to offer specialized adjustments for optimized viewing in bright or direct-sun environments.</p><p> While this particular TV is branded as a full-sun Sealoc unit, underneath the branding and weather-sealing it’s an LG 6-series 4K HDR TV that’s been custom calibrated by Sealoc to offer specialized adjustments for optimized viewing in bright or direct-sun environments.</p><p> I tried to throw every scenario Mother Nature offered at the TV to see just how well the image held up and even in the brightest high-noon sun, the picture was great for watching TV shows or live sporting events.

Now, if you’re hoping to hear every nuance of a movie’s soundtrack you might be disappointed, but if your environment is anything like mine, the stray humming of a lawnmower or leaf blower somewhere in the neighborhood will likely negate any high-quality analysis anyway.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5LTt3_JmSCZ2Cjd0ggeTdVK5pUc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Skyvue_55inch_OutdoorTV_1LW4154865_04_Horiz-f4876803f40845e7a399293e04b71906.jpg"                      alt="SkyVue 55-inch 4K Outdoor TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> I’ll get straight to the point—this TV isn’t cheap. At $3,000, you could go through at least four of the standard LG 6-series units this model is based on. But not a single one of those would last through more than a single downpour.</p><p> This TV is priced at a premium because of the amount of work that’s gone into making it weatherproof and short of a tornado ripping the wall upon which it’s mounted to, this TV can handle it all. So, whether it’s mounted poolside for summer fun or on the viewing platform of your million-dollar yacht, you can count on getting fantastic image and audio quality in the most unlikely of environments.</p><p> Is it worth the premium? That’s up to you and your wallet, but there’s nothing else out there that can replicate the use case and quality this TV has to offer.</p><p> The Sealoc Coastal Silver TV is a niche product with a price to match.</p><h2 id="55-inch-Sealoc-Coastal-vs-SunBrite-55-inch-Pro-Series"><a href="#55-inch-Sealoc-Coastal-vs-SunBrite-55-inch-Pro-Series" class="headerlink" title="55-inch Sealoc Coastal vs. SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series"></a><strong>55-inch Sealoc Coastal vs. SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series</strong></h2><p> While the 55-inch Sealock Coastal is somewhat in a league of its own, outdoor TV manufacturer SunBrite does offer a full-sun 55-inch TV as well. The 55-inch Pro Series (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SunBriteTV-Weatherproof-Outdoor-55-Inch-Television/dp/B07H45Y2LL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077335%7Cn322ca5b212d44e2293bc4c171617475d19%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is designed to be used in full sun like the Sealoc and offers up to 700-nit brightness as well as an anti-glare, impact-resistant screen.</p><p> However, the SunBrite 55-inch Pro Series TV comes in at $5,745, nearly double the cost of the Sealoc TV and doesn’t even feature 4K resolution, let alone HDR compatibility or the webOS smart TV interface. While SunBrite has been an established brand, it’s clear Sealoc wins in both the value and specification department.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-48-inch-tvs-4138374" >Hisense 50H8F Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A well-built 55-inch outdoor TV that can handle the elements.</strong></p><p> The 55-inch Sealoc Coastal Silver Outdoor TV is a niche product with a price to match.

The antenna has a thin, flat, disc shape that is black on one side and white on the other. It is designed to be placed directly onto a flat surface, but you will probably be able to get away with a lot of different orientations depending on how close you are to the signal source.</p><h2 id="Setup-Simple-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Simple-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Simple and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Simple and easy</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna has the simplest setup of all the HDTV antennas I’ve tested. There is no mounting hardware, no power adapter, and nothing else to worry about. The antenna comes with a strip of adhesive that can be used to affix it directly to a wall or other preferred surface.</p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones.</p><p> Luckily the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna comes with a 12ft coaxial cable, so next simply attach the cable to both the antenna and your TV. Make sure to run a channel scan first for best results.</p><h2 id="Performance-Above-average"><a href="#Performance-Above-average" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Above average"></a><strong>Performance: Above average</strong></h2><p> I’ve tested a lot of similar antennas recently, and the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones. From my apartment, I was able to get acquire an average of 65 channels across all my tests. For reference, the worst-performing antenna found just 47, and the best, 76.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Fair-to-middling"><a href="#Range-Fair-to-middling" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fair to middling"></a><strong>Range: Fair to middling</strong></h2><p> Antenna’s Direct rates the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna for up to 35 miles of range, although I’ve seen reports of people getting good results from further, or having trouble from much closer. My apartment is well within the supported range, so my sentiments reflect its use in city settings more than suburbs or exurbs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i57THpEHitQ6h-N5c-bgGLEHwJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_Eclipse_04-6ea1dbbe93374539876c7e76dcebb18e.jpg"                      alt="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the performance</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna lands at an MSRP of $40, putting it towards the high end of the price spectrum, especially where non-powered antennas are concerned. It did do one of the best jobs of supporting as many channels as possible, so the price is somewhat justified. Then again, every single one of the indoor antennas I’ve tested was able to handle the major network channels clearly and without issue, so a high channel number might not mean more than peace of mind in practical terms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna</strong></h2><p> If my testing is any indication of broader performance, there is really no reason to get the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna instead of the ClearStream Eclipse. The Eclipse is over $10 cheaper ($40 vs $52), and managed to support 8 more channels on average. To add insult to injury, the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna is amplified using a USB power adapter, which adds a bit of clutter and complication to the overall setup.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best unpowered indoor antenna.</strong></p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse is one of the best options for buyers looking for a new indoor antenna. It performed better than a lot of the competition, despite being far simpler. Budget shoppers have other cheaper options to consider, but this one is perhaps the best combination of price, performance, and ease-of-use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  ECLIPSE</li><li>Product Brand  Clearstream</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2016</li><li>Weight  4 oz.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model.

For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp; Internet Functionality  Internet video playback, WEB browsing</li><li>Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, LAN, Wi-Fi</li><li>Bluetooth Version  Bluetooth 5.0</li><li>Platform  LG ThinQ AI, webOS</li><li>Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Screen Size  65 inches</li><li>Type  OLED</li><li>Refresh Rate  120 Hz</li><li>Display Format  4k UHD (2160p)</li><li>HDR Technology  4K Cinema HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG)</li><li>Ports  4 HDMI 2.1 Ports, 3 USB Ports</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos 2.2 Channel 40 Watts</li><li>Additional Audio Features  Bluetooth audio streaming, Intelligent Voice Recognition, LG Sound Sync</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars. Its average rating is 4.4 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-We-Test"><a href="#How-We-Test" class="headerlink" title="How We Test"></a>How We Test</h2><p> I reviewed each smartwatch based on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Looks</li><li>Setup</li><li>Ease of daily use</li><li>Battery life</li><li>Device support</li></ul><p> I purchased the Apple Watch Series 9 and Garmin Vivoactive 5, while I borrowed the Google Pixel Watch 2 from a friend.
