Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar

We tried out the Topo by Ergodriven Standing Desk Mat, testing it for comfort, design, and performance.

It comes with two power wedges in the back with calf-stretching inclines in the front that end up going 2.7 inches high, though the bottom platform of the mat is much thinner. It also comes with a massage mound in the center of the mat. For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0MLp0JKyXodrqDxUdun30XlUicQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-3-5e85cbed72974e018684fe954f0ddf1b-75abe4f41eba41c3b202cdf74fbf3caa.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

When we first stepped onto the mat, we really disliked how we couldn’t shift without bumping the massage mound. It’s a great feature if you want to change your ankle stances or relieve your foot pain. However, if you’re standing on the mat for extended hours at a time, your feet are stuck off to the sides and you really can’t shift around as time progresses.</p><p> For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center, we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p> That said, other features of the mat are spectacular. The front wedges are designed to stretch your calves. When we used them throughout the day, they really helped to relieve the tightness from extended standing periods. Though we did feel they were a steeper incline than other mats we’ve recently tested.</p><p> Another great feature is the rear power wedges. While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by. It’s steeper than other models we tested. The steeper incline was better in many ways because it gave us a more intense hamstring stretch. It was a great way to get the blood circulating.</p><p> While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove in which you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by.</p><p> We also liked how the mat slides around on various surfaces, but it’s not too slippery. We hauled it around to various offices with tile and carpet. Each time we set it down, we could push it under the desk with ease if we needed to sit for extended lengths of time and pull it out just as easily when we wanted to stand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat"><a href="#Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat" class="headerlink" title="Price: Pretty steep for a mat"></a><strong>Price: Pretty steep for a mat</strong></h2><p> At around $100 on Amazon, the Topo is in the higher price range for a standing desk mat. We could find models that don’t have the massage mound in the center, however, the steep power wedges in the back make it a reasonable investment for anyone who really wants to stretch out their legs.</p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4737285&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/b2f83c409ce63012229fb9cd465bdcfe/products/copy_reporting_system.png"                      border="0"                >  KoolReport Pro  is an advanced solution for creating data reports and dashboards in PHP.

Price-wise, they’re very similar, retailing around $100. They also come with massage mounds and various power wedges. However, the TerraMat has more features on the mat itself, including a balance bar and plantar mounds off to the sides, as well as a massage mound in the front. None of the actual features are located in the TerraMat’s center, unlike the Topo mat.</p><p> While the TerraMat may have more features for you, it also shows more dirt, which we found was a large turnoff, especially since you’re encouraged to use these mats sans shoes. We really didn’t like putting our feet onto a clearly dirty mat. The Ergodriven mat hides dirt and slides more easily across the floor than the TerraMat. If you prefer a mat that hides the dirt, but still comes with the main stretching features, we recommend the Ergodriven. However, if you want all the bells and whistles to a standing desk mat, we think the TerraMat would be the better choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cubefit-terramat-review-4775307" >CubeFit TerraMat Standing Desk Mat Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Pricey, but solid for the features.</strong></p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice. While we think there are other, better mats out there, but the Topo does hide dirt better, and the deep rear wedges stretch the hamstrings more than most other models on the market. If you want a solid stretch, then the Ergodriven Topo is the best choice for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

It includes the newest version of Samsung’s S Pen, and you can add on a keyboard case to transform the Tab S6 into a hybrid. I tested the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 for about a month, evaluating it to see how it compares to other modern tablets.</p><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 is remarkably slim, measuring only 0.22 inches in thickness, and weighs less than a pound, so it’s not too heavy to take with you on the go either. The interior bezel, which is roughly a quarter of an inch, uniformly bounds the perimeter of the screen, which is constructed of Corning<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gorilla-glass-4160832" >Gorilla Glass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 3.</p><p> The back of the tablet is aluminum, which is ideal for durability and day-to-day use. You can choose between three colors: mountain grey, rose blush, or cloud blue. I tested the mountain grey version. There’s an indenture on the back where you place the included S Pen. It connects to the tablet magnetically, and the tablet also charges the S Pen, which contains an internal battery. In spite of the magnets, the S Pen does come loose from the tablet relatively easily, so I found myself holding it against the tablet when I carried it with me. If you purchase the keyboard case, it includes a cover for the S Pen for a better, more secure placement.</p><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 has a USB-C connector, but no 3.5 mm headphone jack. There’s a microSD card slot on the side to expand your storage to 512 MB, although this is becoming increasingly unnecessary as cloud storage applications become more commonplace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VjADXw7yUZHkkKXdcHBM8o70Ywc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_02-4011b3ea196f44e2a7a111bae1212dc2.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-10-5-inch-Super-AMOLED"><a href="#Display-10-5-inch-Super-AMOLED" class="headerlink" title="Display: 10.5-inch Super AMOLED"></a><strong>Display: 10.5-inch Super AMOLED</strong></h2><p> You can usually rely on Samsung devices to have top-notch display quality, and the Tab S6 is no different. The super AMOLED display is crisp and clear. The text is sharp, and the colors are bright and vivid. The 10.5-inch display feels large enough to watch shows and movies or to use as a hybrid when you connect the keyboard case.</p><p> The screen displays 2560x1600 resolution, with a pixel density of 287 pixels per inch. This is pretty close to on par with the 11-inch iPad Pro, which displays 2388x1668 resolution at 264 pixels per inch, and with the Surface Pro 7, which boasts 2736x1824 resolution at 267 pixels per inch.</p><p> Some users report an issue with the screen, where it randomly goes blank in the middle of using the Tab S6. Audio will still play, but the tablet’s screen will go dark, and the user will have to re-awaken the Tab S6 to continue their tasks. I personally experienced this issue while testing a refurbished version of the Tab S6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-pHfCamdNdeJAmfn1IG93dda0i4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_03-ecf977b8c98b41a08872f0605a589246.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Qualcomm-855"><a href="#Performance-Qualcomm-855" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Qualcomm 855"></a><strong>Performance: Qualcomm 855</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 has the Qualcomm 855 processor, which is a pretty solid mobile CPU. It comes in two versions: one version with 128GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM, and one version with 256 GB of storage and 8 GB of RAM. I tested the former version. On PCMark Work 2.0, the lower level Tab S6 scored a 9022. On Geekbench 5, the Tab S6 scored a single core score of 747 and a multi-core score of 2,518. It’s multi-core scores come in very close to the A12 Bionic chip in the iPad (2019).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TIUmjQSMgpAJw4W3I6fcgiYY1BM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S6_06-cc64b6b41e8f4420b9fe38d223541b52.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-S-Pen-included-keyboard-case-sold-separately"><a href="#Productivity-S-Pen-included-keyboard-case-sold-separately" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: S Pen included, keyboard case sold separately"></a><strong>Productivity: S Pen included, keyboard case sold separately</strong></h2><p> The newest version of the S Pen is Bluetooth enabled, so you can control the Tab S6 tablet remotely. You can snap a group pic from a distance or control a slideshow presentation by swiping to the next slide without touching your tablet. You can use gestures within compatible apps, although few apps have S Pen compatibility.</p><p> The S Pen does allow for more efficient use of the tablet, especially once you get used to it. After about a week, the S Pen became like an extra appendage for me. In addition to quicker screen navigation, the S Pen is excellent for drawing, photo editing, video editing, quick note-taking, messaging on social media, translating, and virtually signing documents.</p><p> The Tab S6 also features Samsung DeX mode, which provides more of a desktop feel, and allows you to cast your display on a larger screen.</p><p> After about a week, the S Pen became like an extra appendage for me.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Dolby-Atmos"><a href="#Audio-Dolby-Atmos" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Dolby Atmos"></a><strong>Audio: Dolby Atmos</strong></h2><p> The Galaxy Tab S6 has four speakers—two on the bottom and two on the top. The speakers are AKG tuned, and they even support Dolby Atmos. You can enable Dolby Atmos in the tablet’s sound settings. Overall, the speakers sound exceptional for a mobile device. I was impressed by the immersive sound quality when watching movies and shows. For music, the bass isn’t as punchy as it could be, but it sounds better than most tablets I’ve encountered.</p><p> I do wish the Galaxy Tab S6 had a headphone jack. I was able to purchase a USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter on Amazon for about $10, but it would have been nice to have a 3.5 mm jack available.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-No-Wi-Fi-6"><a href="#Network-No-Wi-Fi-6" class="headerlink" title="Network: No Wi-Fi 6"></a><strong>Network: No Wi-Fi 6</strong></h2><p> The Tab S6 supports Bluetooth version 5.0 and 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac Wi-Fi networks, and you can connect it on the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. I live in a suburb outside of Raleigh, NC, and my network speeds max out at 400 Mbps. I have a Wi-Fi 6 capable router, but the Galaxy Tab S6 doesn’t support Wi-Fi 6.</p><p> The internet connection is stable, and the Tab S6 appears to have a reliable Wi-Fi adapter.

It has a 13 MP camera and a 5 MP camera on the back, and an 8 MP camera on the front. For a tablet, the camera quality is actually pretty good. It’s not as good as your typical flagship phone, but it’s better than you’d expect on a hybrid tablet. Photos are surprisingly clean and detailed, so you could absolutely get a good group pic at the office, or snap a clear pic of a document you need to send.</p><p> The Tab S6 can take UHD video (3840x2160) at 30 FPS with the rear camera and FHD (1920x1080) at 30 FPS with the front cam, and it has a few cool software features like a food mode, pro mode, night mode, and hyperlapse.

The 7040 mAh battery lasts for up to 15 hours play time. The S Pen does take some of the Tab’s battery, but it doesn’t affect the battery life to a noticeable degree. I was able to use the S6 on and off for most of the day, and I still had some battery leftover for the next day. The Galaxy Tab S4 had a slightly better 7300 mAh battery that lasted for up to 16 hours of play time.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Forerunner 45 is one of the newest devices from Garmin: a running-focused watch with full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to track your runs, hikes, and rides. The FR45 looks and feels like a traditional digital timepiece, featuring a flexible rubber wrist band, an intuitive button interface, and a no-nonsense graphical display. This watch is mostly designed for runners and clearly gets its name with race training in mind, though it’s also suited for any other athletes who are looking to push their limits.</p><p> Despite a heavy focus on running, walkers, hikers and bike riders will also get plenty out of this watch as it includes specific sport modes for each activity. In addition to a host of ‘widgets’ to track your daily fitness like heart rate, step counting, and calorie counting, the FR45 offers more advanced tools like on-screen workouts with the adaptive Garmin Coach training plans for racing various distances.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3-JLbM6PIUG83S2eDF63Qprhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-02-2ae60f7c5a5345ccad8649eadf02637c.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Charge-sync-and-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-Charge-sync-and-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Charge, sync, and go"></a><strong>Setup Process: Charge, sync, and go</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 is easy and quick to set up. Download the Garmin Connect app on your phone or tablet (available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and you can easily sync it to the watch.</p><p> You’ll need the app anyway to view your fitness data, and when you connect it to your Forerunner right out of the box, it also gives you some quick tips for navigating the watch’s interface during the setup process.</p><p> Once you sync it to the app and charge it up to 100%, you’re ready to wear your new Forerunner 45 and get going.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dDyZtrCdCkQOgVcBV6cAwVcFi68=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-04-2c87d86b2b60411b9ebf6696851a2d3b.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Design-Traditional-digital-watch-design-with-all-day-comfort"><a href="#Design-Traditional-digital-watch-design-with-all-day-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Traditional digital watch design with all-day comfort"></a><strong>Design: Traditional digital watch design with all-day comfort</strong></h2><p> Featuring a simple circular watch design and basic rubber wristband, the FR45 looks natural and feels sporty—it’s more understated than flashy. You could certainly wear this watch in a professional setting, but it does not exude the formal or super tech-savvy aesthetic that many smartwatches do these days.</p><p> The unit is lightweight and leaves you unencumbered when you are exercising. The Forerunner 45 does not feel especially rugged or super durable, although it does have a chemically-strengthened glass screen. It’s waterproof to 50 meters, but perhaps disappointingly, this model does not feature any swim mode.</p><p> The screen is totally flush with the bezels and doesn’t leave any space for sweat, grime or dirt to get stuck. The circular bezel of the watch face is rounded and made of the same smooth plastic material that the entire watch body is constructed of (which again does not feel exceedingly durable or rugged), but it sits comfortably flat on the back of your wrist and is easily wearable all day.</p><p> The wristband is made of a flexible silicone material and has a lightly textured exterior side, while the interior side of the band (against your skin) is smooth. Thanks to its comfortable band and smaller overall size, it’s can be worn overnight to get 24&#x2F;7 heart rate data and sleep monitoring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nHZkcIXB7C8qBgrCAwhmdxoMV0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-03-b3713bbdd0f244b889d434fbe17613b7.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Sport-modes-sleep-tracking-and-Garmin-Coach"><a href="#Performance-Sport-modes-sleep-tracking-and-Garmin-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Sport modes, sleep tracking, and Garmin Coach"></a><strong>Performance: Sport modes, sleep tracking, and Garmin Coach</strong></h2><p> We tested the Forerunner 45 on a series of daily trail runs plus a long run and were pleased with its functionality. It features an optical heart rate sensor that charts your average and max heart rates plus an estimation of your V02 max⁠ (the maximum amount of oxygen you can uptake during exercise).</p><p> The ‘Run’ mode features customizable data screens that you can scroll through to review a variety of relevant stats during your workout.</p><p> The Forerunner 45 also has full GPS + GLONASS and GALILEO capabilities. GLONASS is Russia’s version of the American GPS system and GALILEO is the EU’s satellite system, so it really does have all the bases covered here.</p><p> The “Run” mode on the FR45 features customizable data screens that you can scroll through to review a variety of relevant stats during your workout. The default data screen shows your elapsed time, current mile pace and distance, with average and max heart rates, lap times, V02 Max and more that you can review with the push of a button. You can also customize time or distance interval alerts (every 10 minutes, every mile, etc.) and the FR45 will buzz and beep you to notify you of your progress.</p><p> The sleep monitoring feature on the Forerunner 45 tracks how many hours you have slept and periods of movement or restful sleep. This data is reviewable in the Garmin Connect app. The ability of the FR45 to continually track your heart rate and sleep quality overnight makes it a good tool if you are looking to most accurately gauge your resting heart rate and training load before or mid-way through a training program.</p><p> Garmin Coach is a powerful feature on the FR45. When you first sync the Forerunner 45 with your smartphone, the Garmin Connect app will give you the opportunity to select a training program from three real-life professional running coaches. The app has a short video introduction to each coach’s plan and they give you a little info about what their training system is all about. Each plan is a multi-week training program for 5K, 10K, and half-marathon distances.</p><p> The different plans all have you do two to three workouts per week in addition to your easy runs. The Garmin Coach training plans sync with your Forerunner watch and give you onscreen instructions for those workouts, which include intervals, negative splits, tempo runs, long runs, and more. Once you complete a workout during a run, you can select how difficult it was for you and Garmin Coach will adapt its recommendations for you to avoid burnout or overtraining.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app will give you the opportunity to select a training program from three real-life professional running coaches.</p><p> Garmin Coach can also adjust itself based on performance metrics like heart rate and V02 max to either push you if you’re improving or dial things back if you’re going too hard.</p><h2 id="Battery-Long-battery-life-for-days-of-activity-or-races"><a href="#Battery-Long-battery-life-for-days-of-activity-or-races" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long battery life for days of activity or races"></a><strong>Battery: Long battery life for days of activity or races</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 has a rechargeable lithium battery that can last up to seven days in normal watch mode and up to 13 hours continuously when in GPS mode.</p><p> 13 hours in GPS mode means the FR45 won’t die on you in the middle of a marathon, 50K, or possibly even longer races. During our testing process, we found the battery life lasted about four days with daily training runs, all of which lasted around 45 minutes. The FR45 charges back up to 100% in about an hour’s time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n0CH4Oi-eCGFGFAbYCvyN1zYh5s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4057119-05-60bd2ccaf84c4b588407fb69ec57cf39.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Forerunner 45"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Software-Minimal-graphics-with-widgets-in-place-of-apps"><a href="#Software-Minimal-graphics-with-widgets-in-place-of-apps" class="headerlink" title="Software: Minimal graphics with widgets in place of apps"></a><strong>Software: Minimal graphics with widgets in place of apps</strong></h2><p> The FR45 has a minimal OS and the visuals of the display are quite basic. The screen is always on and the simple graphics are designed for high visibility when you are on the move and working out, which is ideal for checking your progress during exercise. The display feels very utilitarian and the graphics do exactly what they intend to do: tell you the info you need to know without any distractions.</p><p> In place of apps on the Forerunner 45, you get widgets for charting wellness model fundamentals like step counting and calories. The FR45 includes Garmin-specific widgets like a stress meter and “body battery,” the latter of which charts how much energy you have throughout the day.</p><p> The entire watch design, app ecosystem, and integration are truly optimized for running, but it does accommodate other sport modes like biking, cardio, walking, and yoga.</p><p> This watch does not have any music storage capabilities or Garmin Pay, but it will show you notifications when in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412" >Bluetooth range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your smartphone and also displays the weather. You can also upload your activities to Garmin Connect and a range of exercise apps including Strava. The entire watch design, app ecosystem, and integration are truly optimized for running, but it does accommodate other sport modes like biking, cardio, walking, and yoga.</p><p> The FR45 has a few safety features, including incident detection and safety alerts. Incident detection can tell if you fall while running or crash on your bike and can send an emergency message to a predetermined emergency contact.</p><p> The safety alert is similar, allowing you to send a preset alert message with your location as a follow link to a designated emergency contact. But unlike incident detection, the safety alert is sent manually and designed to be used any time you find yourself in a potentially unsafe situation while out running or biking. Both of these features require that your smartphone is within Bluetooth range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Training-essentials-for-a-decent-price"><a href="#Price-Training-essentials-for-a-decent-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: Training essentials for a decent price"></a><strong>Price: Training essentials for a decent price</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 carries an MSRP of $199.99, which is a pretty decent deal for a GPS watch with the added Garmin Coach features.</p><p> Garmin has clearly designed the FR45 to be one of the more affordable GPS running watches in its line up, with a prerogative to deliver all the core fitness essentials without any of the ancillary features like maps, music storage, or Garmin Pay that the pricier models play up.</p><p> Unless you are specifically looking for other features in a Garmin GPS watch for specific uses, chances are you won’t miss them for daily running with the Forerunner 45.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Garmin-Forerunner-45-vs-Polar-Ignite"><a href="#Competition-Garmin-Forerunner-45-vs-Polar-Ignite" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Garmin Forerunner 45 vs. Polar Ignite"></a><strong>Competition: Garmin Forerunner 45 vs. Polar Ignite</strong></h2><p> Options abound in the active lifestyle wearables market, and the $200 range is a good benchmark price for getting a full-GPS watch with a variety of training tools.</p><p> A competing model is the Polar Ignite GPS watch, which carries an MSRP of $229.99 and boasts similar fitness tracking features like steps, calories, and continual heart rate monitoring with a circular watch design similar to the FR45. The Ignite has a slightly higher-resolution display and is a touchscreen, but it is designed to only illuminate when you raise your wrist (although settings can be modified to keep the display always-on at the sacrifice of battery life).</p><p> The Polar Ignite features the same full GPS + GLONASS capabilities as the FR45 to track your outdoor activities with pace and distance, plus it includes similar V02 max and optical heart rate sensing capabilities. The Ignite also features Polar’s versions of adaptive training plans called FitSpark Daily Training Guide, which include on-screen workouts and running-specific training programs called Polar Smart Coaching.</p><p> Now for some key differences: Despite hosting a majority of runner-specific features like the FR45, the Polar Ignite has over 100 different sport modes, a ton more than the Forerunner 45. It also has more running-specific modes like trail running and Ultrarunning. The full functionality of these modes is beyond the scope of this review, but it is important to consider how the addition of extra modes really serves your training and intended use.</p><p> While the Forerunner is very focused on the delivery of core data—time, pace, heart rate, and distance—with a no-frills display, the Ignite has a higher level of integration with Polar’s Flow app for all the different activities. Polar seems to be trying to attract athletes beyond the running core that Garmin targets.</p><p> The Polar Ignite also boasts a longer battery life while in GPS + heart rate mode, lasting up to 17 hours. It includes swim tracking (which the Forerunner 45 does not have) and tracks data like heart rate, strokes, distance, pace, and rest times. It can even detect your swimming style. This could be a big plus for triathletes, but it should be noted that the Polar Ignite does not have the ability to sync with a speed sensor on a bike to get cadence data, which the Forerunner 45 can do.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A top-quality running watch at a decent price.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 45 is streamlined to provide all your core training features at a good price. It is definitely geared towards runners and relies pretty heavily on a smartphone connection for its more advanced features. But if you are looking for a reliable GPS watch to help you train—and you don’t want to spend too much—the Forerunner 45 is worth considering.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazfit-bip-review-4773112" >Amazfit Bip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-forerunner-945-review-4768586" >Garmin Forerunner 945 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-inspire-hr-review-4768656" >Fitbit Inspire HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Forerunner 45</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>MPN  010-02156-05</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Release Date  April 2019</li><li>Weight  1.28 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.6 x 1.6 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90-day limited</li><li>Battery  1 x rechargeable lithium polymer battery (included)</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 7 days (smartwatch mode)</li><li>Memory  200 hours of activity data</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android</li><li>Ports  USB charging</li><li>Display  1.04-inch color MIP</li><li>Display Resolution  208 x 208</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-troubleshoot-your-instagram-live-solutions-await/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Troubleshoot Your Instagram Live  Solutions Await</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-enhance-playstation-2-experience-top-5-android-emulators-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhance PlayStation 2 Experience  Top 5 Android Emulators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-practical-steps-for-disabling-youtube-channels-on-devices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Practical Steps for Disabling YouTube Channels on Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-melodic-memberships-leading-online-hubs-for-got-ringtone-purchases/"><u>[New] Melodic Memberships  Leading Online Hubs for GoT Ringtone Purchases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ioneering-the-way-with-innovative-approaches-to-youtube-banners-for-2024/"><u>[New] Pioneering the Way with Innovative Approaches to YouTube Banners for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-channel-expansion-sharing-your-show-across-30-platforms/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Channel Expansion  Sharing Your Show Across 30 Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-compre-written-guide-on-incorporating-markup-features-in-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Compre Written Guide on Incorporating Markup Features in YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-become-a-pic-pro-the-top-10-iphonesandroid-apps-with-stickers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Become a Pic Pro  The Top 10 iPhones/Android Apps with Stickers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-poco-c65-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Poco C65 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/a-leaders-list-of-8-online-havens-for-golden-3d-and-text/"><u>A Leader's List of 8 Online Havens for Golden 3D & Text</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/amazons-echo-vs-alphabets-voice-which-is-the-superior-ai-assistant-for-you/"><u>Amazon's Echo Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729507&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/TIU/Nero_TuneItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                >&#x2F;a&gt;</p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play.

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Everyone loves zombies, but there are so many zombie shooters, it can be hard to tell them apart. But when we played 7 Days to Die, we jumped for joy and grabbed our digital cricket bats, fully prepared to go full Shaun of the Dead on hordes of the undead. A game loosely based around a nuclear fallout that ends with the fall of civilization and the spawning of undead, hungry friends sounds like a good time. Racking up over 500 hours on the game, we’ve tested it across four major alpha updates, taking note of gameplay, plot, ease of use, and price. Read on to find out our thoughts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MW5wYA5ujBjG5LdXn-w9bTJd5WQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-2-a59091cd21c04d99a42270199349fc2a.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die for PC can be located on Steam, making it easy to set up. It takes a little while to download, but once it boots up, you’re in. You’ll press the “New Game” button and you’ll need to create a new character, which is easy if you choose one of the preset characters from the list. If you’d like to make a unique character, it’s easy with a creation system similar to Skyrim. Everything, down to the very arch on the eyebrows, is customizable.</p><p> One of the nicest aspects about 7 Days is that when you boot up a game, and even after, you have a plethora of options to customize gameplay. Do you want Scavenger (easiest setting) or do you want to play on the hardest settings in which the game actually tells you, “You’re one bad mother!”? Do you want the 24-hour cycle to span 30 minutes or two hours of real time? Do you want zombies to sprint at night? How many zombies do you want in your day 7 horde? These are all great options for creating unique and challenging gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Eq0YCIdbj82yj3lOCWEdZS7jX6w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-4-341174c3997543728bd2b024c6e2a309.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox"><a href="#Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Open world horror sandbox"></a><strong>Plot: Open world horror sandbox</strong></h2><p> When you first begin gameplay, it takes about 20 seconds for it to boot up, and then you’re gasping, holding your bare hands out before you, drinking in the landscape of one of five biomes: snow, forest, desert, wasteland, and burnt.</p><p> A prompt flashes onto the screen, beginning a brief tutorial on how to address the basics of the game. This tutorial will take you through basic crafting, helping you to craft axes, plant fiber clothing, and wooden weapons like clubs and bows. It also helps direct you to the nearest Traitor Joe’s general store, where you can buy vital supplies and weapons—but sorry, no overnight stays. After you’ve finished the tutorial, you get some skill points to spend on your skills page, we’ll cover that in more detail below.</p><p> You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake.</p><p> Once you complete the tutorial, it’s an open sandbox sprinkled with horror and survival elements. The game loosely hints of nuclear fallout, but what matters is civilization has recently fallen and you’re the only person alive. Other than that, the world is yours for the conquering. Alpha 17 does have some smaller quests from Traitor Joe’s, like clearing out zombies in a location, or digging up instructions in a marked spot on the map, but overall the goal is survival. Now, this may seem like an easy feat. After all, zombies are shambling, drooling monsters, but 7 Days to Die may surprise you (more on that later).</p><p> The other, titular part of the plot: every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them. As the 7 days pass, they get harder to defeat. Our understanding is that the end goal of 7 Days is to add a story, but right now they’re focused on honing in general gameplay. We hope that the story will be optional since as a survival horror sandbox, it works very well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U2XChOqkiQvFhP69V0cQ5mYcYME=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-3-d19d9b4d19734cffb022d6e0db90382e.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall"><a href="#Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall"></a><strong>Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die boasts two playable maps: Navezgane, which is a massive square map consisting of five biomes in which you can use the sandbox world to your advantage; and random map generation, which is a map that randomly spawns cities and biomes. The latter is for players who want a greater challenge, as no random map is the same. The former, however, has fun elements like a school, complete with charging football zombies, and a strip club. From these two kinds of maps alone, gameplay can last for hours (as we said, we’ve clocked in 500 hours at this point).</p><p> Zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, in 7 Days, Alpha 17 updated it so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease.</p><p> As we previously mentioned, zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, Alpha 17 updated the game so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease. It’s mildly frustrating when you’re trying to protect your base from them and the developers have amped it up so high that you really struggle to defend your base.</p><p> However, if you like that sort of challenge, then, by all means, club and shoot your way through the horde and have a blast. That said, 7 Days also boasts some really cool zombies which make gameplay unpredictable and unique. These include: screamer zombies, which alert and spawn hordes with a banshee-like shriek; spider zombies, which can climb through your windows for an unexpected evening soiree; and policeman zombies, who are a solid combination reminiscent of the Spitter and Boomer from the Left 4 Dead franchise.</p><p> There’s also a skill tree that grants you improved abilities as you go along. We feel this skill tree is mildly flawed, as they want you to slowly build up levels and restrict important aspects—like the forge and bikes—until level 20. In order to do this, you have to grind your way through hordes, as slaying zombies is the most effective way to gain experience and level up. If this is your preference, then you’ll have a blast with this game. If you prefer building and crafting, then we recommend opting for something like Minecraft or Terraria. One quick note—because this is a work in progress game, Alpha 18 has promised to restructure this, so this could change when the new update drops.</p><p> One more huge perk is that each building in the game is like a mini dungeon. Filled with traps, sleeping zombies, and lots of loot, it’s a great addition to a game that needed a little extra effort to make the game fun and playable. For example, in one home we raided on multiplayer, one of us fell through a weak floorboard and ended up in a room full of zombies. However, the loot in the house—a hunting rifle, with a couple weapons modifications to make stronger weapons—made it fun, unpredictable, and worth the scares.</p><p> Every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them.</p><p> For the most part, the controls are really easily manageable on the PC, consisting of the basic, fairly universal WASD keyboard controls. If you don’t like the WASD controls, it’s also very easy to go in and alter them. We liked the ease of use, as we were able to jump into the two maps the game boasts without a rough start. We also liked that because of the easy controls, it was easy to attack zombies with melee and ranged weapons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O0do2JbbpgP_VF7azi5OhENnDpc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-5-13eba1dcdd7d45b48c0c3d07711686e6.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal</strong></h2><p> For a game that was released in 2013 originally, the graphics could be a little better, even if you play on optimal settings. Back in the day, we played on lower settings rather than splurge on a fancy graphics card. If you play on the lower settings, it’s cringeworthy, though not as cringeworthy as the Witcher 3’s lowest settings.</p><p> 7 Days has a decent 3D graphics system that they’ve definitely improved as the alpha updates have been released. As a consequence, the minimum requirements have also increased. Those who play on minimum settings may want to take note of that. While we hope they’ll improve these over the next alpha updates, we are taking the graphics as they are at the time of this review, and right now, while they’re detailed on optimal settings, they could be better.</p><p> Because the graphics are a rather mixed bag, the frames per second (fps) can vary dramatically. We experienced drops as low as 18 fps when playing. When surrounded by a horde, that can cost you your life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Platform-It’s-complicated"><a href="#Platform-It’s-complicated" class="headerlink" title="Platform: It’s complicated"></a><strong>Platform: It’s complicated</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die runs on many platforms:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mac-4155662" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-360-buyers-guide-3562451" >Xbox 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We played 7 Days on PC, and at the time of writing, they released a teaser for the Alpha 18 update which would roll out to the PC version of the game.</p><p> Last time we checked, the company that owned all console rights, Telltale, went bust, and The Fun Pimps (the developer) were in legal limbo trying to reacquire their own rights. There’s a good chance that there will not be an update in the console versions of the game anytime soon as this issue makes its way through the courts. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you purchase the PC version if you decide this is a game you might like to try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713322&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVRadio1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV Radio Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game"><a href="#Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game" class="headerlink" title="Price: Average for an alpha game"></a><strong>Price: Average for an alpha game</strong></h2><p> At around $25, 7 Days isn’t the most expensive zombie game on the market. However, it is the most expensive alpha zombie game out there. Because you can purchase it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Humble Bumble, we recommend waiting for a Steam sale and getting it for a discount, especially since it’s still in progress. This way, if you decide you don’t like it in the future, you aren’t out the full price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters"><a href="#Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other sandbox shooters"></a><strong>Competition: Other sandbox shooters</strong></h2><p> It’s hard to compare 7 Days to other sandboxes out there because of the significant focus on crafting and building.<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has expansive crafting and arguably good graphics with its classic blocky appearance. Terraria also boasts zombies and crafting and building capabilities, though they’re 2D instead of 3D like in 7 Days. And all of them can guarantee hours of gameplay with fun twists and turns.</p><p> If anything can set these games apart, it’s the sheer realism of 7 Days. You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake. And that’s all before we’ve mentioned the wolves and zombie bears (yes, they exist, and no, they are not easy to take down) in 7 Days. If you like a sense of realism in your zombie games, then 7 Days is for you. If not, we suggest taking a look at Minecraft or<a class="link"   href="https://terraria.org/" >Terraria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If you love smart zombies, you’ll love this game.</strong></p><p> Despite flaws in graphics, there’s a lot to love about 7 Days to Die. The challenging skill tree system and dangerous intelligent zombies add an element that’s not typically found in zombie shooters. If you want a game to commit to for hours on end, building bases and exploring dungeon-like homes while slaying zombie cheerleaders, then 7 Days to Die could be a fun way to ease some stress after a long day of work.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li>The Last of Us Remastered</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dying-light-review-4778324" >Dying Light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7 Days to Die</li><li>UPC  017817770613</li><li>Price  $24.99</li><li>Release Date  December 2013</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, PS 4, Xbox</li><li>Processor Minimum  2.4 GHz Dual Core CPU</li><li>Memory Minimum  6 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  1 GB Dedicated Memory</li><li>Game Updates  Alpha 17.4 out;

Although it has fewer features than its bigger sibling, the Versa Special Edition, the new Versa Lite Edition is a powerful tool for tracking your exercise progress and monitoring your wellness.</p><p> With an attractive price point to match it’s confident smartwatch identity, the Versa Lite succeeds at combining affordability and function, striking a fine balance between being a little computer on your wrist and a delimited fitness tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A3jXmqXMfkFi3FKj8NYHxxYKi84=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-03-849db13f6309480cb88c9d05e512f1a1.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Design-Customizable-and-instinctive"><a href="#Design-Customizable-and-instinctive" class="headerlink" title="Design: Customizable and instinctive"></a><strong>Design: Customizable and instinctive</strong></h2><p> With a host of different color options, wristbands, and downloadable clock faces, the Fitbit Versa Lite is a stylish digital watch that’s ready to be customized.

The unit is thoroughly water-resistant, making a day at the ocean or laps at the pool no cause for worry.</p><p> Measuring about 1.5 by 1.5 inches, the touchscreen is easy to wake at any time with the innate ‘screen wake’ feature. If you prefer, you can easily modify the settings to only wake when you press the side button or touch the screen, or you can set it to stay on continually.</p><p> With a host of different color options, wristbands, and downloadable clock faces, the Fitbit Versa Lite is a stylish digital watch that’s ready to be customized.</p><p> The Fitbit OS has an intuitive interface and is easy to navigate. Helpful screen prompts pop up when you enter and exit various modes. There’s also a pause button, which is convenient for any mid-workout pit stops that would otherwise affect your stats.</p><p> Touch and swipe commands are easy and effective, even with sweaty fingers.

The Fitbit app is available for both iOS and Android platforms, and syncing it to the Versa Lite via Bluetooth is very straightforward.</p><p> When you connect your watch to the app the first time, the touchscreen guides you through a series of “Quick Tips” to get you acquainted with the Versa Lite’s layout. The whole process takes about 10 minutes and then you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BD_8kRJ7n6qQdf5LY9rLKiYigTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-05-fac178f5e6b240c29ff8d1e1e4fcb96f.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability"><a href="#Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability"></a><strong>Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite feels nice in your hands and on your wrist. The device is relatively lightweight at 1.41 ounces and the screen unit sits naturally on the back of your wrist. The Versa Lite comes with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring four and 5.25 inches long. Both are a little less than an inch wide and are made of a smooth, soft polymer material which is very comfortable for extended periods of wear.</p><p> Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed.</p><p> Aesthetically, the Versa Lite’s screen and wrist band are attractive and look sleek. You can confidently wear the Versa Lite in any professional setting—it’s good-looking but not overly flashy. Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed and you might find yourself wanting to leave it on the bedside table instead.</p><h2 id="Performance-Lean-and-effective"><a href="#Performance-Lean-and-effective" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lean and effective"></a><strong>Performance: Lean and effective</strong></h2><p> The Versa Lite uses an optical heart rate monitor which applies photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate. This feature shines a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measures how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light, producing a constant stream of heart rate data.</p><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite also has sleep monitoring features, so if you choose to sleep in the watch, the Fitbit app will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages as well as more accurately measure your resting heart rate. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR. Sleep tracking is activated by a combination of complete rest and changes in your heart rates patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV).</p><p> Despite lacking the extra bells and whistles of Fitbit’s more advanced models (such as Fitbit Pay and music storage capabilities), the Versa Lite has all the features any walker, runner, biker, swimmer, weightlifter, or fitness enthusiast will want for goal-setting and training. It does have a few smartwatch features like a weather app and call and text notifications, as well as the Strava fitness app. But it does not have cellular connectivity on its own, and can only display notifications when connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth.</p><p> Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit.</p><p> The GPS capabilities of the Versa Lite are limited in a similar way. The smartwatch does not have full GPS capabilities, so it approximates your distance and pace by measuring your stride length with its built-in step counting technology. If you want this data to be relatively accurate, you’ll have to take your phone along with you so the watch can use what Fitbit calls “connected GPS” to access your smartphone’s GPS signal. Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit compared to the data our other GPS-capable watches collected.</p><p> The Versa Lite has specific modes for running, biking, swimming, walking, treadmill workouts, weight lifting, and interval workouts. These exercise apps chart your workouts and allow you to customize a real-time display of your stats in order to get you the updates you want in the middle of your workout. For instance, the Versa Lite can notify you at predetermined ‘lap’ distances (such as mile intervals) to give you your average mile pace while in “Run” or “Walk” mode. You can easily customize these different stats in the exercise app settings.</p><p> The Versa Lite is water-resistant and rated at a depth of 50 meters, so you can swim with it on and take advantage of its swim mode exercise app. The swimming app brings up one of the flaws we found with our particular Versa Lite: it wouldn’t turn off! There are recent reports on the Fitbit.com forum of some users encountering a strange phenomenon where the swim mode won’t stop when you press the pause and finish buttons.</p><p> It is unclear how many users are affected by this glitch (it seems other users are unaffected) but we experienced it with the Versa Lite Edition we tested. The only way for us to exit the swim exercise app was to hold down the side button for about 10 seconds in order to escape with the factory power cycle feature. This was one of the only significant flaws we found with the Versa Lite, but it did mean that all data for the swim workout was lost after restarting the Fitbit. This essentially rendered the swim mode unusable on our unit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/97XADSG__Ti-9y6W9YfT6A-sRLg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-04-a5baf62c5de749cb93986be2eab3ad2d.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Days-of-activity"><a href="#Battery-Life-Days-of-activity" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Days of activity"></a><strong>Battery Life: Days of activity</strong></h2><p> Fitbit promised four or more days of battery life for the Versa Lite, and they weren’t lying.

These stats include daily step count, total distance covered for the day, daily calorie consumption, active minutes for each day, and a Saturday through Friday graph of your average daily steps.</p><p> A host of other smartwatch apps come standard with the Versa Lite, including alarms, a weather app, a stopwatch, a relaxation app that guides you through short mindfulness exercises, and the specific exercise apps mentioned above. As far as additional apps for the Versa Lite, this is it—the Lite Edition does not have the ability to add extra apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-deal-for-under-200"><a href="#Price-A-deal-for-under-200" class="headerlink" title="Price: A deal for under $200"></a><strong>Price: A deal for under $200</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $159.95 and occasionally selling for less on sale, the Versa Lite is a price-conscious but solid piece of tech that prioritizes exercise. It’s a great introduction to the smartwatch lifestyle with all the notifications you need to be connected and without an overwhelming amount of distractions.</p><p> The ability to train in-depth with the Fitbit app and various Versa Lite exercise apps makes this fitness tracker a pretty good deal for under $200.

Relying heavily on the Fitbit app for its design and integration, the Versa Lite is focused on delivering a targeted dashboard of stats for its users, including Fitbit’s core stats like step counting and calorie counting.</p><p> The new Apple Watch on the other hand, as per Apple’s brand identity, is more geared to synchronizing and integrating with the lives, apps, and products of those already accustomed to the iPhone and Mac brand. In addition to this, Apple’s new Series 4 watches have been redesigned with wellness monitoring features like heart rate tracking and step counting.</p><p> The Apple Watch carries a heftier price tag at $399 (MSRP) without cellular connectivity. If you are not already hooked on the Mac lifestyle or love to accessorize your digital life with apps, the Fitbit Versa Lite should be a worthy consideration for anyone looking to get a quality fitness tracker and well made first-tier smartwatch.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An adept and affordable fitness tracking smartwatch for those who want to keep it simple.</strong></p><p> Though we can’t recommend this watch to swimmers (pending a potential software solution for that glitch), the Fitbit Versa Lite is a great way to chart your progress throughout a training program or competitive season. The combination of the Fitbit Basics and dedicated exercise apps makes this watch both an insightful wellness monitor for everyday activity and a great tool for tracking your fitness progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-forerunner-945-review-4768586" >Garmin Forerunner 945 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-inspire-hr-review-4768656" >Fitbit Inspire HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-review-4766873" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Versa Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>MPN  FB415</li><li>Price  $159.95</li><li>Weight  1.41 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android, Windows 10</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE</li><li>Battery  1 x lithium polymer battery (included)</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 4 days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Display  LCD touchscreen</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>What’s included  Fitbit Versa Lite Edition watch, small wrist band, large wrist band, USB charging cradle</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-how-to-upload-a-video-to-instagram-from-a-desktop-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Upload a Video to Instagram From a Desktop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-timeless-treasures-accessing-fbs-historic-stories/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Timeless Treasures  Accessing FB's Historic Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/ankers-top-notch-led-tactical-torch-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Anker's Top-Notch LED Tactical Torch -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The CB3-532 Chromebook 15 from Acer is by no means a flashy laptop, but that’s likely a positive attribute if you’re in the market for a solid Chromebook. With a price that comes in well under $200, and the processor isn’t going to provide any record-breaking speeds. What you do get is a perfectly functional machine for basic productivity, full web-browsing, media consumption, and even some light gaming.</p><p> You’re also getting a massive display that actually impressed us in our tests, especially when compared to other laptops in this range. I spent a few days of regular use with this Chromebook and broke down what it does well and what corners it has to cut to meet this price point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KPrvN1kvoH081BHRUonphp9CIeY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_02-c3813ec58fc848e6a715abe090ebe6b1.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><h2 id="Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches"><a href="#Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches"></a><strong>Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches</strong></h2><p> The first thing you’ll notice about this laptop is just how large it is. That’s mostly to be expected, because it does sport a 15.6-inch display, meaning the chassis has to be at least that big. But the large, approximately 1-inch bezels around the screen make it pretty large, even considering the expected footprint.</p><p> The color scheme feels very modern, looking very similar to Apple’s space gray. There’s a soft brushed-aluminum-style texture on the top, and a dark, roughened plastic base and inner bezels. There are also two large, round-rectangle speaker grilles flanking the speakers that give it a more assertive look than the usual, simple aesthetic used by other laptops.</p><p> The hinge is actually two small contact points that roll into the laptop chassis, which feels dated when the laptop is open but makes it look interesting when it’s closed. The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around one 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That’s a double-edged sword because while the laptop feels really sturdy and premium despite the plastic material, it isn’t terribly portable.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device"></a><strong>Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device</strong></h2><p> One added benefit to opting for a Chromebook instead of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >full PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that the software is really light. This has implications for both productivity and performance, but it provides a big benefit for the setup process. Because the entire experience, from bootup to browsing, has been designed by Google, you can expect a very similar look and feel to what you’ve probably experienced when signing up and signing in to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-gmail-1172005" >Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or YouTube account.</p><p> The device first asks you to set your regions, then connect to a Wi-Fi network, then finally to sign into a Google account and set up permissions. From here it drops you basically immediately to the Chromebook home screen where you can either dive right in, or follow the popup tour given by Google. One thing I liked a lot about this was that Google gives you a short three-popup tour to start, then asks if you’d like to go deeper or just jump right into the machine yourself. This staged version of a device tour is a great way to let you, the user, tailor it to your preferences. This also makes it great for an older-aged tech user who might need a bit of hand-holding as they get to know their laptop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think"><a href="#Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think" class="headerlink" title="Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think"></a><strong>Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think</strong></h2><p> The display on the Acer Chromebook 15 is bigger than you might expect from a laptop that runs<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-chrome-os-1616448" >Chrome OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with a 15.6-inch backlit LED screen that offers a ton of room for windows and programs. The resolution measures in at 1366x768 meaning it checks all the boxes for being classified as an HD display.</p><p> What surprised me was just how good this screen looks for a budget panel. Most screens at this level will give you just enough pixels to advertise themselves as HD, but will skimp on viewing angles and color representation. But, the screen offers plenty of brightness, and if you turn the blue temperature down a bit (do this in the “night light” part of the Settings section, but turn it on all the time, not just during bedtime), the screen looks really decent.</p><p> The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point"><a href="#Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Really solid, to a point"></a><strong>Performance: Really solid, to a point</strong></h2><p> Chrome OS provides an interesting advantage in the performance category. Right out of the box, this laptop will look and feel very fast, but as soon as you try to open more than about 6 tabs on Chrome, or you fire up multiple apps and videos, it slows down exponentially. On paper, it sports a dual-core Intel Celeron N3060 processor capable for standard-run speeds of 1.6GHz.</p><p> The configuration I chose also includes 4GB of LPDDR3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and 16GB of eMMC memory. These last two points help to make up for the somewhat limited processor by giving decent short-term storage needs and a reasonably fast flash-style memory. But, because the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddr3-vs-ddr4-which-ram-is-best-4779993" >DDR3 RAM is a bit dated <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and caps out at 4GB, you’ll find that it gets a little sluggish when you push it. It’s also unfortunate to see merely 16GB of storage, severely limiting the amount of movies, photos, and files you can fit on the device.</p><p> To be fair, Chromebook users likely keep more files in cloud storage drives, and Google includes 100GB of drive storage for free with the purchase for 2 years. So, you might not notice the limited capacity, but I would have preferred at least 32GB.</p><h2 id="Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features"><a href="#Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features" class="headerlink" title="Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features"></a><strong>Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features</strong></h2><p> There’s an interesting case to be made for this Acer Chromebook in terms of productivity. Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially. This also means that you can load up more than a few Chrome tabs—something that hogs a lot of power use on Windows laptops. Add that in with the larger 15.6-inch display, giving you lots of room for multiple windows and apps, and this Chromebook is great for those who want to multitask. However, because it isn’t a full OS, you won’t be able to run a whole lot of programs out of the box, and you’re limited to what’s available in the Play Store.</p><p> The fit and finish of this laptop also contributes to its productivity capabilities. The full-sized keyboard is actually pretty passable, which is surprising for such a budget device. Because the chassis is thicker, Acer has been able to put in a bit more key travel than you might expect, and even though the action of the keyboard feels just a bit mushy, I found the keyboard pretty great to use.</p><p> I am a little annoyed with the “search” key that Chromebooks placed where a caps lock key should be–resulting in a lot of accidental search callups. The trackpad also leaves a bit to be desired, requiring a firm, chunky press, and doesn’t support as many gestures as Windows or OSX.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-An-unexpected-letdown"><a href="#Audio-An-unexpected-letdown" class="headerlink" title="Audio: An unexpected letdown"></a><strong>Audio: An unexpected letdown</strong></h2><p> Laptops are never amazing specimen when it comes to on-board speakers, so I wasn’t expecting much out of this either. Because it’s a 15-inch machine, there’s plenty of room in the Chromebook 15 for more components, and Acer has opted to put in two giant speaker grilles along either side of the keyboard. Taking that into account, I was hoping that the speakers would be louder and fuller than a normal laptop. However, the response is very tinny and it wasn’t as loud as I was hoping. In fact, these are among the worst speakers I’ve tested on a budget laptop, leaving me to believe that the grilles are just for show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yw3n6Y9SGTIh4h10bF7XbAc5La0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_03-5724a73204e94f548f20aec5fa86074f.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><h2 id="Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS"><a href="#Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS" class="headerlink" title="Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS"></a><strong>Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS</strong></h2><p> Despite the lighter OS, the Chromebook 15 offers modern, well-equipped network features. First off, there’s an 802.11ac-capable Wi-Fi card built-in, which means you’ll get less interference than the N-protocol Wi-Fi, and you’ll have access to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293" >5GHz bands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> common in most modern routers. There’s also Bluetooth 4.2 capability which provided me with a plenty-stable connection for my Bluetooth headphones, and will work nicely if you want to connect a mouse or other peripherals.</p><p> As far as ports go, there are the requisite AC power and 3.5mm headphone input ports, plus a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting an external monitor. There are also two USB 3.0 ports—one on each side—for increased data transfer speeds. I would have liked to see at least one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as the mobile industry is heading decidedly in that direction, but it isn’t the end of the world. There’s also a full-sized SD card slot to help expand the storage of the device, which is important considering how little space is available on the device itself. Overall, this thing checks most of the boxes, though with the large chassis it would have been nice to have seen just a few more I&#x2F;O options.</p><h2 id="Camera-Grainy-but-passable"><a href="#Camera-Grainy-but-passable" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Grainy, but passable"></a><strong>Camera: Grainy, but passable</strong></h2><p> Most laptops I’ve tested at any price point sport a borderline abysmal webcam, so my expectations are never high for low-end laptops like this one. However, even though the pictures and videos recorded are noticeable grainy, the color response was pretty good.</p><p> This is likely because Google is calling this an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -capable webcam, meaning the software is increasing the ISO to give you clear performance. This gives you good color response as I’ve noted, but it does also result in that graininess. This shouldn’t be a breaking point in either direction for considering a laptop like this, but if you do a lot of video calls, it’s an important thing to consider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization"><a href="#Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization"></a><strong>Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization</strong></h2><p> As a light OS, it wasn’t that surprising to see excellent battery life on the Chromebook 15, but I was pleased with just how long the battery lasted. There’s a 3,920mAh lithium-polymer battery that Acer pins at about 12 hours of use. That holds true, perhaps trending toward a little less.</p><p> That’s an impressive performance for a display this large, as there are a lot of pixels to push, but is likely a result of Chrome OS’s light running load and display brightness optimization. The battery also recharges very quickly, allowing for you to quickly add some extra juice to a dying laptop in a pinch. All in all, this is definitely a pro for this device, making it a reliable travel machine.</p><p> Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization"><a href="#Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization" class="headerlink" title="Software: Light and fast with very little customization"></a><strong>Software: Light and fast with very little customization</strong></h2><p> Using Chrome OS is more reliable than you might think. You have most of the functions you’ll need from Google Docs to web browsing to file storage. However, you’ll be missing a lot of more specialized programs, like the full Adobe Creative Suite, or PC-based media programs. Due to the low-powered processor and limited shared Graphics capability, you wouldn’t be able to use this laptop for video editing anyway, even if it did run Windows. So, even though it’s limiting, it’s on purpose.</p><p> That said, the Chromebook 15 runs so well, though likely only because of the lightweight operating system and limited app capabilities. Chrome OS is kind of like just using a Chrome window with a bunch of tabs on a regular PC. For most people, the OS is more than capable of handling most of your browsing needs. This Chromebook is a great example of how far you can push Chrome OS on a budget device, with a big bright screen for watching movies, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer"><a href="#Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer" class="headerlink" title="Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer"></a><strong>Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer</strong></h2><p> The list price for this Acer Chromebook sits at just about $400 (MSRP), but most of the time you can find it on Amazon for between $150-$250. I picked up my unit for about $185, and it tends to hover just around there.</p><p> For the money, I can confidently say this laptop is worth the price, as long as you have the right applications in mind for it. If you want a cheap starter laptop, or a machine for an older family member that’s easy to use, but you don’t want to spend half a grand getting there, this is a great choice. I can’t say it’s quite as travel-friendly as some of the other budget laptops out there, due to the size and weight. But if you want an affordable machine that’s great for light productivity tasks, and is an excellent movie machine, then you should consider this.</p><h2 id="Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14"><a href="#Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14"></a><strong>Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14</strong></h2><p> Lenovo’s entry into the large, budget Chromebook range brings a few different features into play. The most notable difference is the build—you’ll get a thinner, sleeker laptop with the Lenovo, including a much more premium-looking and -feeling keyboard, plus 64GB of storage and a lighter weight. However, you’ll sacrifice the Intel processor (the Lenovo sports a more dated chip from MediaTek) and the battery life isn’t quite as good. That package comes in at a little higher on the price scale, too.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A solid Chromebook for productivity, but limited in portability.</strong></p><p> This is a great Chromebook with a lot of impressive things to offer. The bright screen has plenty of room for vibrant video viewing and multiple windows of productivity. The excellent battery life means you won’t be tethered to a desk, and the light, fast Chrome OS means it will take a lot to slow the Acer Chromebook 15 down. However, the limited onboard storage, bulky size and weight, and the lack of full app choices might limit you a bit too much. At the end of the day, at this price point, it’s perfect for light, basic use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698827&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3REpage-newmainscreenshot.png"                      border="0"                >DEX 3 RE is Easy-To-Use DJ Mixing Software for MAC and Windows Designed for Today’s Versatile DJ. </p><p> Mix from your own library of music, iTunes or use the Pulselocker subsciprtion service for in-app access to over 44 million songs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The in-car USB charger market is virtually flooded with offerings for virtually any taste to any<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-to-buy-for-under-300-4045957" >budget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — from the cheap and chintzy to high-tech. The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Don’t let the diminutive blue<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desk-lamps-4135707" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously. What’s more, it can do that without<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/problem-with-overheating-laptops-2377646" >overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle"><a href="#Design-All-plastic-but-sturdy-and-subtle" class="headerlink" title="Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle"></a><strong>Design: All-plastic, but sturdy and subtle</strong></h2><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 might not be the sharpest or most cutting-edge looking in-car USB charger, but what it lacks in visual pizazz, it more than makes up for in sturdiness.</p><p> A lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-usb-port-not-charging-phone-4102780" >in-car USB chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are susceptible to slowly fragmenting. If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddpai-mini3-review-4770579" >DDpai mini3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C450 Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Apeman</li><li>MPN  X0023JN4OL</li><li>Price  $39.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 4.2 x 3.8 in.</li><li>Camera  170-degree FOV, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  1080p</li><li>Crash Detection  Yes</li><li>Parking Mode  Yes</li><li>Connectivity options  USB</li><li>Storage  Up to 32GB SDHC card (Class 10)</li><li>Warranty  12 months</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-prime-communication-tools-for-remote-teams/"><u>[New] Prime Communication Tools for Remote Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-final-word-on-vegaspro-2019/"><u>[Updated] The Final Word on VegasPro 2019</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-using-obs-for-gamers/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Using OBS for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-videography-6-tips-for-making-macro-video/"><u>2024 Approved  Videography  6 Tips for Making Macro Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/amazon-fire-vs-samsung-tablets-a-comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-the-best-device/"><u>Amazon Fire Vs.

ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 is one of the best all-around options on the market today, providing a sizable cell with speedy charging across phones, tablets, laptops, portable game systems, and more, plus a slim design and great price.</p><p> I tested ZMI’s PowerPack 20000 time and again over more than a week across multiple devices, measuring the charging speeds and comparing it to other similar power banks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jITowxAWHBUo5WF3Y-XI6lKQNQE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-05-02d76c869b864ef0abddfe824cfbf53a.jpg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-powerful"><a href="#Design-Small-but-powerful" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but powerful"></a><strong>Design: Small but powerful</strong></h2><p> The ZMI PowerPack 20000’s size is easily one of its biggest selling points. While it is a little heavy at 14.3 ounces, this power bank is the approximate width and height of a large smartphone, measuring up very closely to the size of my Apple iPhone 11 Pro at 6.3 x 3.2 inches (HWD). Of course, the 0.8-inch thickness is quite a bit larger than any phone today, but unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> It’s smooth navy blue aluminum on the outside with a black plastic strip running along the entire frame, with one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Power Delivery 2.0 port and two USB-A ports on one end. Nearby on the upper right side frame is a power button and four small lights that indicate how much power the bank is currently holding.</p><p> Unlike most laptop-friendly charging banks, ZMI’s can still fit into a pocket or handbag with ease.</p><p> The button also serves another very handy purpose: press it twice in a row and you’ll enable USB devices to be used by a connected computer. I plugged the ZMI PowerPack 20000 into a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/huawei-matebook-x-pro-signature-edition-review-4845244" >Huawei MateBook X Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop and then plugged a USB mouse into the power bank, pressed the button twice, and then was able to use the mouse on the laptop. That’s incredibly helpful for slim, premium laptops that have very few ports.</p><p> This power bank doesn’t have an AC port for full-sized power plugs, as some competing power banks do, but it also costs less and is much smaller than those alternatives typically are.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaINPELrwcWnOZDsX1ztKkCouww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zmi-03-1530f666df824f6281040c2ae3285eb2-2e7956941b91403aa888795a7e5e2e33.jpeg"                      alt="ZMI PowerPack 20000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-does-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-does-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy does it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy does it</strong></h2><p> There’s not much to the setup process here. Using the included USB-C to USB-C cable, simply plug one end into the power bank and the other into an AC adapter that you have handy—like one for a laptop, tablet, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Once the four lights on the side are fully illuminated, then the battery pack is fully charged.

When the charging process was complete, the PowerPack still had one light illuminated, indicating that there was still a little bit of battery life remaining.</p><p> In a separate test, I had the ZMI PowerPack 20000 power the MacBook Pro as it played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at full brightness. With the PowerPack plugged in, the laptop maintained its 100 percent charge for 8 hours, 4 minutes before the power bank ran out of juice.</p><p> The PowerPack 20000 also charged a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone from nothing to 100 percent in 1 hour, 47 minutes using the USB-C PD port, with four lights still remaining on the power bank.

Those are both stellar benefits, plus the fabric-lined exterior gives it a distinctive allure. That said, Mophie’s pack sells for $200, and we’d only recommend it if you must have the AC power outlet for charging a power-hungry laptop. If the ZMI PowerPack 20000 will meet your charging needs, however, it’s a much better bargain.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fantastic portable laptop battery charger for nearly everyone.</strong></p><p> It’s honestly difficult to find anything to complain about with the ZMI PowerPack 20000. It’s powerful and does a great job of charging laptops and phones, it has enough capacity to handle those tasks with ease, it’s compact and well-designed, and the price is fantastic. It’s half the size of the giant Anker power brick that I’ve brought on my last two international trips and can handle all of the same tasks. In other words,<em>this</em> is the power brick I’m bringing on my next trip.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerPack 20000</li><li>Product Brand  ZMI</li><li>SKU  X001ESM8MV</li><li>Price  $70.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.3 x 3.2 x 0.8 in.</li><li>Warranty  18 months</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 2x USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-bridging-shadows-and-highlights-the-lightroom-hdr-methodology/"><u>[Updated] Bridging Shadows and Highlights  The Lightroom HDR Methodology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-your-contents-impact-smart-utilization-of-igtv-hashtags/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhancing Your Content's Impact  Smart Utilization of IGTV Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice.techidaily.com/2024-approved-6-best-voice-changers/"><u>2024 Approved 6 Best Voice Changers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/affordable-amazonbasics-television-aerial-assessment-cost-effective-channel-access/"><u>Affordable AmazonBasics Television Aerial Assessment -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Omnicharge Omni 20+ is a special sort of power bankthat tries to be all things for all people. With a decent 71Wh capacity and a wide variety of ways to input and output power, including USB-C and a wireless Qi charger, it comes pretty close.</p><p> Always on the lookout for ways to simplify my road kit, I recently slipped an Omni 20+ into my messenger bag to see how well it can stand-in for the assortment of chargers I normally pack. Through about a week of use and testing, I was able to get a pretty good feel for how well the Omni 20+ performs, how well it charges a variety of devices, and whether or not it’s worth the fairly stiff asking price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lFGiT6009F_OKGOJ-sLcNKNylt0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-2-9a3217b3ee154a3ebcb38e61aac3be52.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Slick-all-black-appearance-that’s-dulled-a-bit-by-soft-touch-rubber"><a href="#Design-Slick-all-black-appearance-that’s-dulled-a-bit-by-soft-touch-rubber" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slick all-black appearance that’s dulled a bit by soft-touch rubber"></a><strong>Design: Slick all-black appearance that’s dulled a bit by soft-touch rubber</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ is a great looking device, with an all-black case and gem-cut edges that fit in nicely when used alongside my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-spectre-x360-15t-touch-laptop-review-4773540" >HP Spectre x360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The top and bottom are completely bereft of any markings, hiding the presence of a Qi wireless charger hidden in the top, and the labels that it does have for inputs and outputs are understated.</p><p> The power inputs and outputs are all located on the front and sides of the device, which minimizes cord clutter a bit. I prefer power bricks that allow you to plug everything into one side, but the Omni 20+ is set up more cleanly than some I’ve used.</p><p> My one real issue with the design is the choice to use soft-touch rubber. It looks nice now, and it feels nice, and I suppose it helps absorb some shock when packed away for travel, but this is a material that just isn’t made to go the distance. Soft-touch rubber tends to degrade and get sticky over time, attracting all manner of lint and dust, and also becoming quite unpleasant to touch.</p><p> The USB-C port is capable of fast charging some devices and providing up to 60W of power.</p><p> For a premium device with a premium price like the Omni 20+, I’d like to see a different material used for the case.</p><h2 id="Initial-Setup-Frustrating-due-to-a-lack-of-documentation"><a href="#Initial-Setup-Frustrating-due-to-a-lack-of-documentation" class="headerlink" title="Initial Setup: Frustrating due to a lack of documentation"></a><strong>Initial Setup: Frustrating due to a lack of documentation</strong></h2><p> While it’s clear that a lot of thought and care went into designing the Omni 20+, it’s just as clear that almost no thought was given over to the packaging and documentation. When you open the box, you’re greeted with the battery itself, a USB-A to C cable, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to C cable, and a couple of brochures. One of those brochures is marked as a quick start guide, but it really isn’t.</p><p> The two things lacking in this presentation are a charging cable and an actual instruction manual, the latter of which ends up being a huge problem due to the confusing nature of the display and controls.</p><p> When you look at the Omni 20+, you can see that the barrel jack and USB-C plug are both marked IN&#x2F;OUT, indicating that you can use these ports to charge the battery or to charge other devices.</p><p> I tried using the included USB-A to C cable to plug the Omni 20+ into the BESTEK power strip tower I keep on my desk, but it didn’t work. There was some kind of miscommunication somewhere between the circuitry in the power strip USB ports and the Omni 20+ that caused the charging process to start and stop over and over at very short intervals.</p><p> The next thing I tried was the USB-Charger that came with my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and that worked just fine. According to the documentation that’s available from the Omnicharge website, but not in the box, you can use a USB-C charger up to 45W, or you can use a 5.5x82.1mm barrel plug that falls anywhere in the 4.5 - 36V range.</p><p> Once you’ve fully charged the Omni 20+, you need to discharge and then charge it again to completely calibrate the battery. The USB-C port is plug and play, meaning you can plug any USB-C device in and power it up without changing any settings, but you do have to use the somewhat confusing LCD display if you want to charge using the power outlet, barrel connector, or the USB-A ports. None of this is terribly complicated, but I did need to download an instructions PDF from the official Omnicharge site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QOfV3Sc5THi3Z0gKZq0e-ciPUEE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-5-000854ae3c4347b7adc13130dcb9d1b9.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Display-Crisp-and-easy-to-read-but-confusing"><a href="#Display-Crisp-and-easy-to-read-but-confusing" class="headerlink" title="Display: Crisp and easy to read, but confusing"></a><strong>Display: Crisp and easy to read, but confusing</strong></h2><p> The display is small, but it’s quite bright and easy to read. The only issue is that it isn’t particularly easy to figure out what the individual icons mean, or how to use the display to change input and output settings, without referring to an instruction manual that isn’t included in the box.</p><p> I’ve already covered the issue with the manual in the previous section, so suffice it to say I recommend avoiding frustration and just downloading the manual from the Omnicharge website rather than trying to figure out the display and controls on your own.</p><h2 id="Sockets-and-Ports-Excellent-array-including-wireless"><a href="#Sockets-and-Ports-Excellent-array-including-wireless" class="headerlink" title="Sockets and Ports: Excellent array, including wireless"></a><strong>Sockets and Ports: Excellent array, including wireless</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ includes a nice array of sockets and ports, managing to cover all of the important bases with ease. On one side, you’ll find a USB-C port and a barrel connector port, which are both capable of charging the Omni 20+ or providing power to other devices.</p><p> The USB-C port is capable of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-fast-chargers-4774501" >fast charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> some devices and providing up to 60W of power. This isn’t universal, but it worked for my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-3-review-4589365" >Pixel 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the other devices I had on hand for testing.</p><p> The barrel port can be used to power up your laptop and other devices that normally require an external power adapter. To accomplish that, however, you’ll need a 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel plug and an adapter tip designed for your device.</p><p> I did have a barrel connector and adapter tip on hand to charge my HP Spectre x360 on the road, and appreciated the fact that I was able to leave the power adapter at home. For a power bank in this price range, though, I’d expect the necessary hardware to be included in the box.</p><p> While this power bank isn’t going to keep all of your devices fed all day, the most important thing is that it features pass-through charging.</p><p> If you don’t mind packing extra adapters, or you have a device that won’t accept a fast charge over the included USB-C port, then the Omni 20+ does include a perfectly functional AC outlet on the other side. This is a nice touch for the sake of compatibility, but I see a power bank like the Omni 20+ as a way to reduce clutter, so I look at the power outlet as more of a useful backup than something I want to use every day.</p><p> On the front of the power bank, next to the display, you’ll find two USB-A ports. These ports are capable of charging all your standard USB devices. One is a Qualcomm 3.0 compatible quick charge port, and the other is a standard USB port that’s capable of putting out up to 3A.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Decent-battery-capacity-for-the-size"><a href="#Battery-Decent-battery-capacity-for-the-size" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Decent battery capacity for the size"></a><strong>Battery: Decent battery capacity for the size</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ includes a 20,000 mAh battery, which is a decent capacity for the size of this power bank. I’d like to see a larger capacity based on the price of this unit, but it’s clear that you’re paying for extra features like fast USB-Charging and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/qi-wireless-charging-4151894" >wireless charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of a big battery.</p><p> In practice, I found that the Omni 20+ wasn’t able to fully charge my HP Spectre x360, although the beefy battery and 17-hour runtime on that laptop means that I was still able to get a considerable boost from this power bank. When charging my Pixel 3, I found that I was able to get four charges out of the Omni 20+ with a little juice left over.</p><p> While this power bank isn’t going to keep all of your devices fed all day, the most important thing is that it features pass-through charging. That means you can charge the Omni 20+ while it charges or powers your devices, allowing it to function as a universal power adapter in addition to a power bank.</p><p> By plugging the Omni 20+ into power when available, I found it to be a fantastic replacement for an otherwise bulky assortment of power adapters for my laptop, phone, and other devices.</p><p> When charged over USB-C using an appropriate charger, like my Nintendo Switch charger, the Omni 20+ takes about three hours to charge to full. Charging it with a weaker charger, or over the barrel connector, takes a bit longer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aZDfINCcUg9uIHRuhVr2k3wmX94=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-1-815fe3c777eb4f46a77cb00127bd88c2.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

Older devices that charge over standard USB-A ports will draw between 1 and 3 A, depending on the device, and charge quite slowly. But if you have a Qualcomm 3.0 compatible device, you can plug it into the appropriate USB port and enjoy faster charging.</p><p> My Pixel 3 drew 1.46A when plugged into the USB-A ports, regardless of which port I chose. Other devices drew between 0.37 and 1.46A.</p><p> When plugged into the USB-C port with the included USB-C cable, I found that my Pixel 3 charged just as quickly as if I were using the factory charger. It drew 11 watts of power when plugged in via USB-C and entered its “charging rapidly” mode. I also plugged the factory charger into the included power outlet, and noticed no difference in speed.</p><p> I was also able to charge other USB-C devices, like my Nintendo Switch, with no problems.</p><p> By plugging the Omni 20+ into power when available, I found it to be a fantastic replacement for an otherwise bulky assortment of power adapters for my laptop, phone, and other devices.</p><p> The built-in Qi charger is capable of putting out 10 watts, and I found it to work just as well as other 10 watt Qi chargers I’ve used. It is a bit touchy in terms of positioning, but I was able to get the hang of it pretty fast.</p><h2 id="Price-High-end"><a href="#Price-High-end" class="headerlink" title="Price: High end"></a><strong>Price: High end</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $200, Omni 20+ is a high-end battery bank with a high-end price. You get a whole lot of functionality for that price, but the device does lag behind in terms of both battery capacity and included accessories. The glaring issue is that you can find more powerful battery banks for less money, even if you won’t find one with the exact same functionality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

With that disparity in price, it would seem like these devices aren’t even in the same category, but they actually have some important similarities. In fact, the 23,000 mAh battery in the Pilot Pro 2 is even a bit more powerful than the Omni 20+.</p><p> The most onerous difference between these two devices is that the Pilot Pro 2 comes with a barrel connector and a nice set of adapter tips. With an MSRP almost double that of the Pilot Pro 2, it’s a bit galling that the Omni 20+ doesn’t even come with a power adapter, let alone the hardware necessary to charge your laptop.</p><p> The Omni 20+ does come out ahead in a lot of areas. It includes wireless charging, which the Pilot Pro 2 lacks. It also offers both Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging over USB-A and high wattage fast charging over USB-C, and comes with a power outlet, all of which are features that the Pilot Pro 2 lacks.</p><p> The Omni 20+ is clearly the more fully-featured of these two battery banks, so why does the much cheaper Pilot Pro 2 come with a nice assortment of accessories that Omnicharge leaves you to find on your own? The Omni 20+ is clearly the better power bank, but this kind of price tag demands a less spartan box.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Fantastic functionality, decent battery capacity, and frustrating setup experience.</strong></p><p> The Omnicharge Omni 20+ is one of the best power banks out there, and it had better be for the price they’re asking. This is the power bank you need if you count a high wattage USB-C port, barrel connector input and output, wireless charging, and a standard power outlet among your needs. You can find cheaper power banks that provide more juice, but you won’t find one with this same feature set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  20+ Wireless Power Bank</li><li>Product Brand  Omni</li><li>Price  $200.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  5 x 4.8 x 1.1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Capacity  18650mAh Li-ion</li><li>Output  100W (outlet), 60W (USB-C), 10W (wireless)</li><li>Warranty  One year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-streaming-quality-for-instagram-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Streaming Quality for Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-capturing-moments-right-ideal-perspectives-on-iphone/"><u>[New] Capturing Moments Right  Ideal Perspectives on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-enhance-your-iphone-footage-from-speed-to-extended-muted-visuals-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhance Your iPhone Footage  From Speed to Extended, Muted Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-enjoy-every-frame-best-free-download-apps-for-mobile-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enjoy Every Frame  Best Free Download Apps for Mobile Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/n-2024-advanced-techniques-using-jump-cuts-effectively/"><u>[New] In 2024, Advanced Techniques  Using Jump Cuts Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-kinemaster-unveiled-the-best-game-on-your-android-device/"><u>[New] KineMaster Unveiled  The Best Game on Your Android Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-mastering-profit-on-facebook-essential-insights-and-hacks-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Profit on Facebook  Essential Insights & Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-s3700-blu-ray-box-player-fresh-perspective/"><u>[New] S3700 Blu-Ray Box Player -

Keep reading for the full product review.</em></p><p> The Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) is one element of the second generation of Lenovo’s M10 budget-priced Android tablet line. It features a big 10.3-inch full HD display, a huge battery, decent cameras for a tablet in this category, stereo sound with Dolby Atmos, and all at an affordable price point. It can also be used as a smart display when connected to an optional charging dock, but only if you buy it together with the dock.</p><p> I recently had the opportunity to pack along a Tab M10 FHD Plus as part of my daily carry, using it for everything from email to streaming video and even some video conferencing over the span of about a week. I tested everything from overall performance and battery life to camera quality and wireless connectivity to see if this budget Android tablet rises above the crowd or disappears inside it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-New-Better-specs-and-price-than-the-first-gen-Tab-M10"><a href="#What’s-New-Better-specs-and-price-than-the-first-gen-Tab-M10" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: Better specs and price than the first-gen Tab M10"></a>What’s New: Better specs and price than the first-gen Tab M10</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) is one successor to 2019’s Tab M10. It packs a slightly more powerful processor, bigger battery, and batter cameras. The display remains unchanged in resolution, but the Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) does have a slightly bigger display. The price tag of the Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) is also a bit smaller.</p><h2 id="Design-Attractive-metal-design-feels-solid-in-the-hand"><a href="#Design-Attractive-metal-design-feels-solid-in-the-hand" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive metal design feels solid in the hand"></a>Design: Attractive metal design feels solid in the hand</h2><p> The second gen Tab M10 FHD Plus has a premium look and feel that helps set it apart from a lot of budget Android tablets. The big 10.3-inch display dominates the front of the tablet with an expansive 82-percent screen-to-body ratio, with fairly thin side bezels and chunkier top and bottom bezels to accommodate the selfie cam on one end and provide balance on the other.</p><p> I love that Lenovo included stereo speakers here, and that they are on opposite ends of the tablet when you hold it in portrait mode.</p><p> The body is metal and uniformly gray, with cutouts on either end to house the inputs and speakers that are a slightly different tone of gray. It feels solidly built, and while the all-metal construction makes it a bit heavy, I never found it uncomfortable to hold.</p><p> The top edge holds a speaker grill and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, while the bottom has a second speaker grill and a USB-C port. I love that Lenovo included stereo speakers here, and that they are on opposite ends of the tablet when you hold it in portrait mode. The USB-C port is also a nice touch, as a lot of budget Android tablet makers are still clinging to their outdated microUSB ports.</p><p> The right edge of the tablet holds the power button and volume rocker, along with a micro SD card tray that you can use to expand onboard storage. If you opt for the LTE model, the same drawer also has a slot for a SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ma5tHUu5pX1_gI7bCahJfUmTcJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10FHDPlus_04-5bc59222ddfe4d488b3aaf566fdf3300.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The left edge is less interesting, as it’s bare aside from Lenovo’s dock connector. Unless you buy the version of the tablet that includes a dock, this connector is useless. You can’t buy the dock separately, and the version of the tablet that doesn’t ship with a dock has different firmware that locks out most of the dock functionality anyway.</p><p> The back of the tablet has the aforementioned cutouts on the top and bottom, and the single rear-facing camera in the upper left corner. Aside from the Lenovo logo, Dolby logo, and an informational sticker that you’re free to remove, that’s it.</p><h2 id="Display-Great-looking-full-HD-screen"><a href="#Display-Great-looking-full-HD-screen" class="headerlink" title="Display: Great-looking full HD screen"></a>Display: Great-looking full HD screen</h2><p> Like the first generation of Lenovo’s M10 hardware, the Tab M10 FHD Plus features a full HD display. The 10.3-inch IPS LCD panel has a resolution of 1920 x 1200 for a display ratio of 16:10 and a pixel density of about 220 ppi. The result is a bright, colorful, beautiful display that looks great even when viewed from right up close.</p><p> I watched a number of movies and TV shows on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831" >Netflix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hbo-max-how-to-watch-it-4782926" >HBO Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , videos on YouTube, and played a few games like Asphalt 9, and I was almost universally impressed with the display. The colors look great, the image is nice and crisp without visible pixelation, and it has great viewing angles thanks to the IPS panel.</p><p> One issue I ran into is that this tablet supports only Widevine L3, which means some apps aren’t able to display high definition content. For example, everything I watched on Netflix was a bit blurry since Netflix is locked to SD resolutions on devices that don’t support Widevine L1 or L2. Other apps, like HBO Max and YouTube, look great in full HD.</p><p> The colors look great, the image is nice and crisp without visible pixelation, and it has great viewing angles thanks to the IPS panel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Decent-enough-for-the-price"><a href="#Performance-Decent-enough-for-the-price" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent enough for the price"></a>Performance: Decent enough for the price</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus is powered by an octa-core Mediatek MT6762 Helio P22T chip, and it’s available in a handful of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and storage configurations. You can get it with 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, 64GB and 4GB, or 128GB with 4GB of RAM. My test unit was the 128GB &#x2F; 4GB model.</p><p> While this processor is a bit on the weaker side, I found the Tab M10 FHD Plus to run just fine for a tablet in this price range. I didn’t notice any real slowdown when navigating menus in Android 10, which is a problem I have run into with other low-priced Android devices, and most apps launched pretty quickly. I did notice that it isn’t really cut out to run a lot of games, and I wasn’t even able to install my go-to test game, Genshin Impact, at all, but basic tasks like email, web browsing, and streaming video were all smooth as can be.</p><p> To get a solid baseline of what you can really expect from this hardware, I ran a handful of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-benchmark-2625811" >benchmark tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The first test I ran was the Work 2.0 benchmark from PCMark, which is designed to simulate a variety of productivity tasks. In the Work 2.0 benchmark, the Tab M10 FHD scored 5,316, which is pretty good for this hardware configuration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tt3HD9uM-f4_vqoAxok0dfwOVb8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10FHDPlus_02-264a43b354b148d7bfeea1a952ddcb71.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> For more specific benchmarks, the Tab M10 FHD Plus scored 5,266 in web browsing, 4,360 in writing, and 3,851 in data manipulation. That’s a great web browsing score, but the writing and data manipulation scores are a bit disappointing. The Tab M10 HD, which is a second generation M-series tablet that’s priced lower than the Tab M10 FHD Plus, scored a bit better in those areas.</p><p> I also ran a couple graphics benchmarks from GFXBench. The first one I ran was Car Chase, which is a game-like benchmark that tests how well a device handles lighting, physics, and other things. It hit just 5.9 FPS in that benchmark, which is significantly better than the 3.4 FPS I saw from the less expensive Tab M10 HD, but still very unimpressive. It did better in the less intense T-Rex benchmark, registering a playable 31 FPS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Excels-at-basic-productivity-tasks"><a href="#Productivity-Excels-at-basic-productivity-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Excels at basic productivity tasks"></a>Productivity: Excels at basic productivity tasks</h2><p> With its big 10.3-inch display and decent overall performance, the Tab M10 FHD is positioned better as a productivity device than a lot of other tablets in this class. It excels at basic productivity tasks, like email and web browsing, and it’s a great little tablet to have on hand as an auxiliary or secondary device.</p><p> Due to slightly slugging performance in some areas, however, it’s tough to recommend for any real work. I did pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard to do a little writing when I was away from the office, but that isn’t a usage scenario I’d really recommend.</p><p> I also used it for a handful of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/discord-4174046" >Discord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video calls, but the low quality selfie cam failed to impress in that department. It works well enough in a pinch, but I wouldn’t recommend it as a primary device for word processing, video conferencing, or anything along those lines.</p><h2 id="Audio-Stereo-sound-with-Dolby-Atmos"><a href="#Audio-Stereo-sound-with-Dolby-Atmos" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Stereo sound with Dolby Atmos"></a>Audio: Stereo sound with Dolby Atmos</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus includes stereo speakers located on opposite ends of the device and support for Dolby Atmos. While it isn’t the best-sounding tablet I’ve ever tested, it’s great for a device in this price range. There isn’t a whole lot of bass, but everything sounded quite clear without any harsh tones or strange vibrations.</p><p> When I loaded up YouTube Music and turned up the volume all the way, I found that the Tab M10 FHD Plus was loud enough to easily fill a large room. I didn’t notice a whole lot of distortion at the highest volume, but it was loud enough that I found it more comfortable to listen to at three quarters volume or less.</p><h2 id="Network-Good-Wi-Fi-network-speeds-with-an-LTE-option"><a href="#Network-Good-Wi-Fi-network-speeds-with-an-LTE-option" class="headerlink" title="Network: Good Wi-Fi network speeds with an LTE option"></a>Network: Good Wi-Fi network speeds with an LTE option</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus supports dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0, with additional support for low energy Bluetooth. There is also a version that includes LTE support, but my test unit did not include that functionality.</p><p> During my time with the Tab M10 FHD, I primarily used it in concert with a gigabit cable internet connection from Mediacom and an Eero wireless network. I used it for email, web browsing, and video streaming, among other tasks, from a variety of locations, and I never had any problems with dropped signals or poor connections.</p><p> In order to put the Tab M10 FHD to the test, I downloaded the Speed Test app from Ookla, disabled the beacons in my Eero mesh Wi-Fi system, and checked connection speeds at various distances from the router.</p><p> When measured at about 3 feet from the router, the Tab M10 FHD registered a top download speed of 249 Mbps and an upload speed of 71.5 Mbps. That’s pretty decent for a device in this price range, although I’ve seen significantly higher speeds from other devices. At the time of testing, I measured a download speed of 980 Mbps at the router, but the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen on the network is closer to 400 Mbps.</p><p> Next up, I took the Tab M10 FHD Plus into a hallway around the corner at a distance of about 10 feet from the router. At that distance, the connection speed dropped to 184 Mbps. I then took it about 60 feet from the router into another room with walls and other obstructions in the way, and the speed dropped only to 182 Mbps.

It has the same 8MP sensor on the back and 5MP selfie cam that you get in the less expensive Tab M10 HD. These cameras are more acceptable in the less expensive version of the hardware than they are here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fW7pWFeGLdIkaBDNJBR5LIE2TF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10FHDPlus_03-638edb188f924604b2d38f1307add396.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The rear camera turns in uniformly disappointing results. Even given perfect light outdoors, shots tended to look washed out, unfocused, and lacking in detail. In less-than-perfect light, I found it very difficult to avoid blown-out photos, tons of noise, or even both in the same shot.</p><p> The selfie cam is sufficient for video calls, but it wouldn’t be my first choice. Video looks washed out and flat, with excessive noise depending on the lighting conditions. Photos look like artifacts from a different time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Could-use-a-bigger-battery"><a href="#Battery-Could-use-a-bigger-battery" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Could use a bigger battery"></a>Battery: Could use a bigger battery</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus includes a 5,000 mAh battery and supports up to 10W charging. The battery is the same one found in the less expensive Tab M10 HD, and it should really be bigger due to the increased power consumption of the bigger display. When using the tablet during the day for email and web browsing, and at night to stream videos, I found myself needing to put it on the charger every day.</p><p> To test the battery, I connected to Wi-Fi, opened YouTube, and streamed HD videos nonstop until the tablet died. Under those conditions, I found it to last only about four hours. You could get more time out of it by shutting off Wi-Fi or lowering the screen brightness, but it still isn’t that great a battery life, and this tablet could definitely use a bigger battery.</p><p> The battery is the same one found in the less expensive Tab M10 HD, and it should really be bigger due to the increased power consumption of the bigger display.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Originally-shipped-with-Android-Pie-now-comes-with-Android-10"><a href="#Software-Originally-shipped-with-Android-Pie-now-comes-with-Android-10" class="headerlink" title="Software: Originally shipped with Android Pie, now comes with Android 10"></a>Software: Originally shipped with Android Pie, now comes with Android 10</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus originally shipped with Android Pie, but my test unit came equipped with Android 10 from the factory. There are a couple important takeaways from that.</p><p> First, make sure which version of Android the tablet has before you buy it, as you may come across old stock with Android 9. The update may be available immediately in that case, or you may have to wait. Additionally, it’s unlikely the tablet will receive any further OS updates since it’s already technically received one.</p><p> Lenovo’s implementation of Android 10 is essentially stock, and I found it to run quite well. There are no unnecessary changes, additions, or cumbersome UX tweaks layered on top. You get pretty close to a stock experience, with the notable addition of Google Kids Space. This is a welcome addition, as it’s totally optional. You can ignore it if you bought the tablet for yourself or an older teen, or open the app and set it up if you want to provide tons of pre-approved apps, books, and other content for a younger child.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-price-for-a-basic-Android-tablet"><a href="#Price-Decent-price-for-a-basic-Android-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent price for a basic Android tablet"></a>Price: Decent price for a basic Android tablet</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD has an MSRP of between $149.99 and $209.99 depending on the configuration you choose, with the version that includes a dock being a bit more expensive, and those prices are pretty reasonable. I’ve also seen it on sale for a bit less than that, at which point it makes the move from adequately priced to a great deal. If you find the configuration I tested, with 4GB of RAM, it’ll be priced closer to $149.99—a fantastic value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6jtXbNEbp6IeWqkD4Bs-0KjGx4Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10FHDPlus_05-afa4a59fc67343c785979e6eb3f67c48.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Lenovo-Tab-M10-FHD-Plus-2020-vs-Lenovo-Tab-M10-HD"><a href="#Lenovo-Tab-M10-FHD-Plus-2020-vs-Lenovo-Tab-M10-HD" class="headerlink" title="Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) vs. Lenovo Tab M10 HD"></a>Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) vs. Lenovo Tab M10 HD</h2><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus and Tab M10 HD are similar tablets that share the same processor, similar RAM and storage configurations, and look almost identical to each other. The Tab M10 FHD Plus is a bit bigger thanks to its larger display, and it also has a higher resolution.</p><p> For those reasons alone, the Tab M10 FHD Plus gets a stronger recommendation despite the more affordable price tag of the Tab M10 HD. The only exception is if you’re buying a tablet for a younger child who may not care about being able to make out the individual pixels on the screen, in which case the more aggressive pricing of the Tab M10 HD makes it a good choice.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Great little tablet for the price, but make sure you don’t need the dock.</strong></p><p> The Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020) is a great option if you’re looking for a basic Android tablet for less than $200. It can’t stand up to more expensive tablets, but it’s great for basic tasks like email, web browsing, and streaming media. The only issue is that you can’t get the dock separately, so make sure to grab the Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus that includes the dock if you want that functionality.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-p11-pro-review-5116910" >Lenovo P11 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review-5095689" >Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-tab-4-review-4691612" >Lenovo Tab 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Tab M10 FHD Plus (2nd Gen)</li><li>Product Brand  Lenovo</li><li>MPN  ZA5T0237US</li><li>Release Date  March 2020</li><li>Weight  16.16 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.61 x 6.04 x 0.32 in.</li><li>Color  Iron Gray, Platinum Gray</li><li>Price  $149.99 - $209.99</li><li>Warranty  13 months</li><li>Platform  Android 10 (originally Android 9)</li><li>Processor  Octa-core MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22T</li><li>RAM  2GB &#x2F; 4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB &#x2F; 64GB &#x2F; 128GB</li><li>Camera  5MP (front) &#x2F; 8MP (rear)</li><li>Screen  10.3-inch IPS LCD</li><li>Resolution  1920 x 1080</li><li>Battery Capacity  7,000 mAh &#x2F; 10W charging</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-close-shots-avoiding-distortion-in-videoleap-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Close Shots  Avoiding Distortion in Videoleap Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-live-video-capture-with-logitech-webcam-technology-for-2024/"><u>[New] Perfecting Live Video Capture with Logitech Webcam Technology for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-add-music-in-premiere-pro/"><u>[Updated] Add Music In Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-vidma-screen-recorders-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Evaluating the Effectiveness of Vidma Screen Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-minimizing-movement-blur-in-media/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Minimizing Movement Blur in Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-reel-in-the-solution-to-instagram-video-glitches-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Reel in the Solution to Instagram Video Glitches for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-utilizing-luts-for-enhanced-color-correction-in-pscc/"><u>2024 Approved  Utilizing LUTs for Enhanced Color Correction in PSCC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2024s-leading-body-cams-reviewed-find-the-perfect-fit/"><u>2024'S Leading Body Cams Reviewed - Find the Perfect Fit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2024s-market-leaders-a-comprehensive-review-of-premium-server-rack-units/"><u>2024'S Market Leaders: A Comprehensive Review of Premium Server Rack Units</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-tecno-phantom-v-flip-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Tecno Phantom V Flip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-premium-cable-modems-for-enhanced-connectivity-in-202-5/"><u>A Comprehensive List of Premium Cable Modems for Enhanced Connectivity in 202 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/amazfit-bip-smartwatch-unveiled-a-comprehensive-review-for-newbies/"><u>Amazfit Bip Smartwatch Unveiled: A Comprehensive Review for Newbies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/amd-radeon-r9-no-more-woes-on-windows-10/"><u>AMD Radeon R9 No More Woes on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/battle-of-tablets-ipad-pro-vs-surface-pro-unveiled/"><u>Battle of Tablets: IPad Pro Vs.

However, you shouldn’t write these single-unit routers off, as they can offer high-end performance, especially if you don’t have a large living space you need to cover.</p><p> The Asus RT-AC88U, in fact, may be one of the best single-unit wireless routers on the market today, as it offers a respectable range, awesome performance, and a suite of features that make it stand out among the competition. We spent over a week testing it in a home environment, using it with multiple devices for all purposes including browsing, streaming, downloads, and gaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Watch-the-edge"><a href="#Design-Watch-the-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design: Watch the edge"></a>Design: Watch the edge</h2><p> Most gaming accessories in 2018_look_ like gaming products. They have edgy angular designs, red accents and bright LEDs. For the Asus RT-AC88U, the first two are certainly true—this router looks like something straight out of Battlestar Galactica. It has a black, angular design with four antennas jutting out of the sides and the back. These antennae have red highlights, making the router eye-catching if you put it in your living room or next to your PC. This design won’t appeal to everyone, obviously, but if it doesn’t offend your aesthetic, the Asus RT-AC88U is capable of some pretty amazing things.</p><h2 id="Setup-Get-up-and-running-quickly"><a href="#Setup-Get-up-and-running-quickly" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Get up and running quickly"></a>Setup: Get up and running quickly</h2><p> Setting up the Asus RT-AC88U is a breeze, which was a bit surprising since most gaming routers take a bit of tinkering. You’ll have to reset your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-modem-817861" >modem <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and hardwire it into a desktop computer via the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —no smartphone app-based setup here. Then, a portal will pop up in your web browser, where you’ll enter the default password that’s provided with the router. After creating a more secure password, you can run through the setup wizard. The Asus RT-AC88U will automatically detect your ISP and configure settings to get the best performance. All you’ll really have to do is choose your SSID and password and you’ll be good to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tJSyhJYa8-MA9hCZoZxMCn1_GoI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-1_6-3b7dfd6e10f84ca0a965905f4fbceb6c.jpg"                      alt="Asus RT-AC88U Gaming Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> We connected it to our 250 Mbps Xfinity connection, and within a few minutes, after updating the firmware, we were getting phenomenal speeds with little to no fiddling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-A-dream-come-true-for-gamers"><a href="#Connectivity-A-dream-come-true-for-gamers" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: A dream come true for gamers"></a>Connectivity: A dream come true for gamers</h2><p> Ask any gamer, and they’ll probably tell you that wired connections are the only way to go, and that playing online games over a wireless connection is a recipe for disaster. And, generally, we’d have to agree that wired connections are better for online gaming. Luckily, the Asus RT-AC88U is rocking 8 Gigabit LAN ports. This means you can keep your gaming PC, consoles and anything else that needs a solid connection hardwired to your router.</p><p> But, having all computers in your home hardwired to a router isn’t possible for everyone. So it should come as a relief that wireless connectivity is generally excellent here. The dual-band AC3100 connection, backed up with MU-MIMO support and adaptive Quality of Service, which prioritizes network traffic, means that you can reliably game over a wireless connection as well.</p><p> A perfect fit in any smart home, allowing you to set up automated programs with a variety of smart devices.</p><p> The router also features a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so you can connect a printer or external hard drive for network access. What’s especially cool, however, is the native Time Machine support built into the Asus RT-AC88U’s back-end, making Mac backup a breeze—something we didn’t expect from a router explicitly marketed to gamers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Kicking-it-old-school"><a href="#Software-Kicking-it-old-school" class="headerlink" title="Software: Kicking it old school"></a>Software: Kicking it old school</h2><p> Unlike many other wireless routers in 2018, the Asus RT-AC88U doesn’t rely on smartphone apps to manage and set-up your network. Instead, you get a pretty traditional browser-based management portal. This might be off-putting to anyone that isn’t comfortable fiddling around with complex settings, but if you want to have that extra degree of control there’s a lot you can do to make your network run how you want.</p><p> You can manage clients connected to your router, view system logs, change which wireless channels you run on and so much more. The Asus RT-AC88U is a dream come true for the power users out there and is filled to the brim with software features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HIJ1YoiZU5EbjoLtmqEOszPEwQc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-1_3-7da5546e1b544459a0a87a7b1698cb47.jpg"                      alt="Asus RT-AC88U Gaming Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> Chief among these is the adaptive QoS, which gives the Asus RT-AC88U an edge over other routers when it comes to gaming. The router will automatically prioritize traffic from gaming applications — or any other kind of apps that you choose — so that you get the most network performance where it matters.</p><p> The Asus RT-AC88U also has built-in malware protection, AiProtection, which will allow you to temporarily disable antivirus on your gaming PC, so you can dedicate more resources to the games you’re playing.</p><p> The router is a dream come true for the power users out there, and is filled to the brim with software features.</p><p> But, this router does more than_just_ cater to gamers. Built-in Time Machine functionality for Macs, simple cloud storage, and Alexa integration make this router appeal to everyone in your home, no matter what kind of tech they’re into. And, IFTTT integration (if this, then that) means that this router is a perfect fit in any smart home, allowing you to set up automated programs with a variety of smart devices.</p><h2 id="Performance-High-speed-no-lag"><a href="#Performance-High-speed-no-lag" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High speed, no lag"></a>Performance: High speed, no lag</h2><p> When you’re opting for a high-performance gaming router like the Asus RT-AC88U, you get exactly what you’re paying for. When it comes to raw speed and latency, this router performs with the best of them. And, that MU-MIMO (Multi-user, multiple input, multiple output) compatibility means that you can have a dozen devices all sucking bandwidth at the same time without bottlenecking each other.</p><p> In fact, we decided to put this to the test. We set up a desktop, a MacBook Pro, a smart TV, a tablet and a Windows laptop, and had them all stream 4K video at the same time. Even in this stressful scenario, we didn’t run into any buffering, and had smooth video playback. If you live with several gamers and tech addicts like we do, the Asus RT-AC88U will be able to keep up without breaking a sweat.</p><p> Everyone can do whatever they need to do, without inconveniencing other people in the house.</p><p> Unfortunately, the Asus RT-AC88U Gaming Router doesn’t have the same range that comparable mesh routers have, and you likely won’t be able to get a strong signal across a large home or office. But, that’s not what this router is designed for, and in our average-sized home we didn’t have any problems with the router’s range. We were able to get reliable speeds in the upstairs bedroom despite the router being placed in the living room downstairs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gaming-Like-no-other"><a href="#Gaming-Like-no-other" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Like no other"></a>Gaming: Like no other</h2><p> Right after setting the Asus RT-AC88U up, we wanted to put its gaming capabilities to the test – was it actually better for gaming, or was it just a marketing ploy?</p><p> Well, it’s definitely better for gaming than your average router. We played Overwatch over a wireless connection, while watching Netflix on three different devices. We didn’t see a single lag spike. The adaptive QoS feature we mentioned earlier was able to ensure that latency was kept to a minimum, even while we were using a significant amount of data at the same time.</p><p> But what’s more surprising is that this QoS prioritization didn’t get in the way of the streams themselves being smooth. The Asus RT-AC88U isn’t just going to be great for anyone looking to minimize their gaming downtime, it’s going to be great for everyone in the household. You can eliminate arguments over bandwidth entirely — everyone can do whatever they need to do, without inconveniencing other people in the house.</p><h2 id="Price-Premium-price-for-a-premium-experience"><a href="#Price-Premium-price-for-a-premium-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Premium price for a premium experience"></a>Price: Premium price for a premium experience</h2><p> The Asus RT-AC88U is not a cheap router by any means, and you’re paying a premium for the gaming-centric features this router boasts. And, we don’t really have a problem with this. At $299, it’s pricey, but not so much that it’s out of reach for large, multi-device households that really need its features.</p><p> This router offers some of the best performance you can ask for.</p><p> For smaller households, the features won’t really justify the price — not to mention the design that makes it hard to_not_ notice. These days, devices like the $129 Google Wifi make a lot more sense for the average consumer that doesn’t need heavy-duty networking. But if you do need a heavy duty router like the Asus RT-AC88U, $299 is a small price to pay for the quality of life improvement.</p><h2 id="Asus-RT-AC88U-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-Pro-Gaming-XR500"><a href="#Asus-RT-AC88U-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-Pro-Gaming-XR500" class="headerlink" title="Asus RT-AC88U vs. Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR500"></a>Asus RT-AC88U vs. Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR500</h2><p> The Asus RT-AC88U isn’t the only gaming router out there, in fact, there’s been a deluge of routers focused on gaming over the last few years. And, some premium gaming routers like the Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR500 give the Asus RT-AC88U a run for its money. But at $297, Netgear’s gaming router is about the same price, and it offers a more user-friendly software solution on top of similar MU-MIMO and QoS functionality. In fact, these two routers are so close together in a performance that picking the one that’s best for you will almost entirely depend on aesthetics.</p><p> Read more reviews of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >best wireless routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-secure-routers-4140134" >best secure routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available to purchase online.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>One of the best routers for gaming.</strong></p><p> Beyond jumping to a wireless mesh system, which brings problems of its own, this router offers some of the best performance you can ask for. It’s a great choice for anyone looking to squeeze out all the potential from their broadband connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see.

There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-high-impact-imaging-our-favorite-7-4k-cameras/"><u>[New] In 2024, High-Impact Imaging  Our Favorite 7 4K Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-windows-10s-premier-choice-of-video-grabber-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Windows 10'S Premier Choice of Video Grabber Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-brevity-in-action-the-process-of-shortening-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Brevity in Action  The Process of Shortening YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamlining-your-show-formatting-podcast-xml-successfully/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamlining Your Show  Formatting Podcast XML Successfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-animators-dream-tools-premium-choices-for-3d-mastery/"><u>[Updated] The Animator’s Dream Tools  Premium Choices for 3D Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-record-the-essence-of-your-facebook-page/"><u>2024 Approved  Record the Essence of Your FACEbook Page</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-12-pro-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 12 Pro without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-the-robust-and-user-friendly-design-of-the-acurite-pro-01036m-weather-station-reviewed/"><u>A Closer Look: The Robust & User-Friendly Design of the AcuRite Pro 01036M Weather Station Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-vpna-fake-gps-location-free-review-on-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Apple iPhone SE (2022) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/ace-your-budget-gaming-needs-with-acer-aspire-e-15-the-consensus-pick-for-economical-high-performance-computing/"><u>Ace Your Budget Gaming Needs with Acer Aspire E 15 -

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!--
