Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135355/19272" target="_top" id="2135355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135355/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/he-beginners-guide-to-video-equipment-selection/"><u>[New] The Beginner's Guide to Video Equipment Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-start-to-finish-itunes-video-logging/"><u>2024 Approved From Start to Finish ITunes Video Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snapchat-cameos-catch-up-with-the-trendiest-trick/"><u>2024 Approved Snapchat Cameos Catch Up with the Trendiest Trick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-nokia-c02-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Nokia C02 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comparing-sound-quality-google-nest-audio-vs-apple-homepod-showdown/"><u>Comparing Sound Quality: Google Nest Audio Vs.

If you’ve got the budget for both a high-end GPU and CPU, and your CPU choice doesn’t entail downgrading to a slower GPU than you originally planned to get, go for it.</p><p> Similarly, if you plan to use your PC for more than gaming, especially for CPU-heavy workloads such as video editing, getting a high-end CPU is justified. My only advice here is to think twice about whether that flagship CPU you’re eyeing gives you enough of a performance bump to justify its price compared to allocating that budget to another component.</p><hr><p> Lastly, if you’re a professional who wants to build a capable workstation you’ll use both for business and fun, a high-end CPU—or even <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/step-into-a-tiktok-realm-a-guide-for-joining-lives-for-2024/" >a flagship CPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if your work depends on it—makes perfect sense.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-efficient-image-capturing-made-simple-the-best-pc-snipers-listed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Efficient Image Capturing Made Simple The Best PC Snipers Listed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-breaking-down-whatsapps-voice-call-features-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Breaking Down WhatsApp's Voice Call Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-game-changer-how-bandicams-2023-update-transforms-capturing-games/"><u>2024 Approved A Game Changer How Bandicam's 2023 Update Transforms Capturing Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/apple-vision-pro-assessment-are-its-features-worth-it/"><u>Apple Vision Pro Assessment: Are Its Features Worth It?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-guide-master-adobe-captivates-screen-capture-feature/"><u>Cutting-Edge Guide Master Adobe Captivate's Screen Capture Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/declutter-data-step-by-step-hdd-defrag-for-win11/"><u>Declutter Data: Step-by-Step HDD Defrag for Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/from-novice-to-numerical-fluency-spanish-numbers/"><u>From Novice to Numerical Fluency: Spanish Numbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/hands-on-experience-with-top-notch-dell-monitor-premium-anc-earphones-and-high-definition-camera/"><u>Hands-On Experience with Top-Notch Dell Monitor, Premium ANC Earphones, & High Definition Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/how-to-review-and-edit-web-pages-pre-upload-for-a-flawless-launch/"><u>How To Review and Edit Web Pages Pre-Upload for a Flawless Launch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-powerpoint-to-video-best-practices-with-webcams-now/"><u>In 2024, PowerPoint to Video Best Practices with Webcams, Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-hp-stream-14-economical-windows-notebook-and-its-limitations/"><u>In Depth Look at the HP Stream 14 - Economical Windows Notebook & Its Limitations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s5e-premium-features-at-your-fingertips/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e: Premium Features at Your Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/solving-the-issue-windows-cant-find-appropriate-printer-drivers/"><u>Solving the Issue: Windows Can't Find Appropriate Printer Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-singing-machine-sml385btbk-hands-free-user-friendly-karaoke-experience/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Singing Machine SML385BTBK: Hands-Free, User-Friendly Karaoke Experience</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

class="headerlink" title="What to Look for With a Meta Quest 3 Accessory"></a>What to Look for With a Meta Quest 3 Accessory</h2><p> While there are a diverse set of accessories for a device like the <a class="link"   href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-securing-the-title-top-5-hmds-for-drone-pilots-for-2024/" >Meta Quest 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are some universal things we want to see in an accessory to make it worth considering.</p><p> First, the accessory must improve some aspect of the standard Quest 3 experience. Different people have different needs, and no accessory will perfectly meet all those needs. For example, some people may not find the Quest 3 comfortable as it comes from the factory, but with the right accessory, this can be addressed. Some accessories might look like an improvement at first, but turn out to be pointless, or even make the experience worse.</p><p> Second, we want accessories that are reasonably priced. One of the major strengths of the Quest 3 is its competitive pricing, so you don’t want to erase that advantage with overpriced add-ons. The value proposition must be significant.</p><p> Third, the accessory must make your Quest 3 more convenient or pleasant to use in some way, with few if any drawbacks in other areas. For example, a new head strap should significantly increase comfort without making the headset too hard to adjust or put on.</p><p> Lastly, the accessory needs to be durable, especially since the Quest 3 is a wearable that will be jostled around, bumped into walls, and taken from place to place as a portable system. If one of these accessories helps make the Quest 3 even more durable, then all the better!</p><p> With that said, let’s look at the Meta Quest 3 accessories that impressed us the most.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>4</td><td>50</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

These will work with just about anything that supports USB audio, so you can also get low-latency audio with your Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5 and so on.

However, it’s never an entirely elegant solution, and some glasses are just too big to fit in the Quest’s eye box. So, the best option is to use prescription lenses designed to fit inside the headset.</p><p> While there are third-party options, we think the <a class="link"   href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-3-zenni-vr-prescription-lenses/" >official VR prescription lenses by Zenni <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are the best choice, particularly thanks to the streamlined ordering process. You can enter your prescription manually, upload or photograph your prescription, or provide it after purchase at a later date. You also have the choice of either an anti-fog coating or an anti-oil coating.

Where the Quest 2 offers up to three hours of playtime, the Quest 3 runs out of puff at around the two-hour mark. Quest 3 users do have the option of using <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23930552/meta-quest-3-v59-software-update-battery-saver-mode-youtube-live-chat" >battery-saver mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that brings it up to three hours, but it’s at the expense of graphics quality. At that point, you may as well have stuck with the Quest 2. Luckily, you can add extra battery life by using the <a class="link"   href="http://www.amazon.com/BINBOK-VR-Compatible-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B0CKXN1HDD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Binbok VR T3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Now, it’s important to understand that this is also an elite strap-like replacement headstrap. So, if you want a different headstrap, this product won’t work for you. That being said, it’s better to have an extended Quest battery as part of a strap. By going this route, you also get the bonus of a better-balanced headset, and you don’t have to worry about a wire trailing down to a power bank clipped to your belt.</p><p> The T3 has a neat hot-swap system, although the cheaper model we’re highlighting here makes the hot-swap aspect irrelevant. If you want two batteries, you’ll need to buy the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BINBOK-VR-Replaceable-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B0CJN9D23X/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Binbok VR T3 Dual Battery Combo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. However, before you automatically assume that this is the right move, do you need an extra four hours of runtime over and above the two hours offered by the Quest’s internal battery? Six hours of VR is an incredibly high amount, so we think a single extra battery will be more than enough for most people.</p><p> Generally, buyers seem quite thrilled with the T3’s performance, but one minor complaint from some user reviews notes a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IR3RO19JDNM1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >buzzing sound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The volume isn’t such that you’d notice while listening to headphones or concentrating on your game, but if you think a bit of power humming will distract you, opting for a battery that sits further from your head might be a good idea.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-3.png"                      alt="The Binbok TR V3 battery strap for Meta Quest 3"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Battery Pack for Meta Quest 3</p><h5 id="Binbok-VR-T3-1"><a href="#Binbok-VR-T3-1" class="headerlink" title="Binbok VR T3"></a>Binbok VR T3</h5><p>The Binbok VR T3 offers both a comfortable strap, and a hot-swappable magnetic battery that adds two hours to your play time per battery. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BINBOK-VR-Compatible-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B0CKXN1HDD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Meta-Quest-3-Link-Cable-Syntech-Link-Cable"><a href="#Best-Meta-Quest-3-Link-Cable-Syntech-Link-Cable" class="headerlink" title="Best Meta Quest 3 Link Cable: Syntech Link Cable"></a>Best Meta Quest 3 Link Cable: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Transfer-Charging-Headset/dp/B098399X91/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Syntech Link Cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-1.jpg"                      alt="A woman wearing a Quest 3 VR headset with a Syntech cable plugged into it."                > </p><p>Syntech</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Long</td><td>Doesn’t charge headset (but extends play time significantly)</td></tr><tr><td>Cheap</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Realiable</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> These days, it’s preferable to connect your Quest to your PC using a wireless connection with the official Air Link feature.

You don’t have to worry about battery life, and you get the most stable, high-quality VR experience possible.

However, while this will slow down how quickly your Quest 3 drains its battery, there’s generally not enough power coming from a typical computer USB port to charge the headset, especially with a cord this long.

This is a great way to improve comfort as you won’t feel the cord touching your arm all the time. These grips are specially made to leave all the sensors on the Touch Controllers open, whereas some other grips block certain sensors, reducing tracking accuracy. It’s also simple to slide them off to access the Touch Controller battery, but Touch Controller battery life is so long that this will rarely be an issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-5.png"                      alt="Two meta Quest 3 controllers with grip covers."                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Controller Grip Covers for Meta Quest 3</p><h5 id="DESTEK-Silicone-Controller-Grips-for-Meta-Quest-3-1"><a href="#DESTEK-Silicone-Controller-Grips-for-Meta-Quest-3-1" class="headerlink" title="DESTEK Silicone Controller Grips for Meta Quest 3"></a>DESTEK Silicone Controller Grips for Meta Quest 3</h5><p>These grip covers streamline and improve the standard Meta Quest 3 controller experience without breaking the bank.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Controller-Compatible-Durable-Magnetic-Accessories/dp/B0CMBKH3T8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001433&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-meta-quest-3-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="How-do-I-clean-and-maintain-my-Meta-Quest-3"><a href="#How-do-I-clean-and-maintain-my-Meta-Quest-3" class="headerlink" title="How do I clean and maintain my Meta Quest 3?"></a>How do I clean and maintain my Meta Quest 3?</h3><p> The outer plastic shell of the Quest 3 can be wiped with a damp, lint-free cloth, taking care to avoid the external camera lenses.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-in-Kodi-Unveiling-Version-20-5-with-Exciting-Enhancements"><a href="#New-in-Kodi-Unveiling-Version-20-5-with-Exciting-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="New in Kodi: Unveiling Version 20.5 with Exciting Enhancements!"></a>New in Kodi: Unveiling Version 20.5 with Exciting Enhancements!</h2><p>Kodi, formerly known as XBMC, is one of the most popular media center interfaces around with support for a wide variety of devices. The next Kodi 21 update is nearing completion, but in the meantime, the development team has one more update for the current Kodi 20 branch.</p><p> The development team for Kodi has just released Kodi 20.5, which aims to be “the final release for the Nexus line.” That’s what the developers said for <a class="link"   href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-overcome-common-errors-troubleshooting-fortnite-loading-failures/" >the Kodi 20.3 update back in January <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but a few more bugs were discovered that needed to be fixed.</p><p> Kodi 20.5 reverts many of the changes for controller support that arrived in the 20.4 update, because they caused “massive failures on Android devices.” It also fixes a bug that caused Kodi to close on Android devices during potential color mode changes, and audio playback has been improved to match the upcoming Kodi 21 Omega update.</p><p> The update also includes support for the “inputstream.ffmpegdirect” addon for Kodi on iOS and tvOS, and brand colors have been added for the Flathub store on Linux and potentially other software repositories. There are also a few minor fixes in the libraries used by Kodi.</p><p> The Kodi team said in a blog post, “As this is a point release, there are no major changes since the previous version, and you should be fine to install this straight over the top of any existing Kodi 20.x installation - indeed, this will happen automatically on many platforms. However, as for all software installations, back up your userdata beforehand if you’ve any doubts or have anything you can’t afford to lose (and definitely do this if you’re going for a major version upgrade).”</p><p> Kodi 21 is expected to arrive sometime soon, as it has <a class="link"   href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-your-account-after-being-hit-by-the-newest-dota-2-cheat-detector/" >been in beta testing for a few months <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> already. It’s primarily focused on under-the-hood changes and making Kodi easier to improve and maintain in future releases. There are a few new features though, such as read and write support for M3U8 music playlists, improved Dolby Vision support, better passthrough audio format support on Linux devices, and some visual improvements for Windows.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-20-5-nexus-release/" >Kodi Blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhance-communication-and-accessibility-leading-tts-apps-reviewed-for-mac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enhance Communication and Accessibility Leading TTS Apps Reviewed for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-memetic-mayhem-the-20-most-shared-gems/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Memetic Mayhem The 20 Most Shared Gems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-how-to-boost-your-youtube-revenue-from-mobile-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>[Updated] How to Boost Your YouTube Revenue From Mobile - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unbeatable-method-for-permanent-bio-link-integration-in-tiktok/"><u>2024 Approved Unbeatable Method for Permanent Bio-Link Integration in TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/7-fixes-for-unfortunately-phone-has-stopped-on-google-pixel-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>7 Fixes for Unfortunately, Phone Has Stopped on Google Pixel 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-soft-reset-tecno-phantom-v-fold-phone-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Soft Reset Tecno Phantom V Fold phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/pickus-claim-the-ultimate-editor-or-just-another-featured-app-in-android/"><u>PickU's Claim – The Ultimate Editor or Just Another Featured App in Android?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/price-hikes-coming-for-spotifys-solo-pair-and-family-plans-across-america/"><u>Price Hikes Coming for Spotify's Solo, Pair & Family Plans Across America</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/revitalize-your-latest-computer-with-these-spectacular-retro-game-challenges/"><u>Revitalize Your Latest Computer with These Spectacular Retro Game Challenges!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/say-goodbye-to-steam-link-woes-uncover-powerful-open-source-streamers-like-moonlight-and-sunshine/"><u>Say Goodbye to Steam Link Woes!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Banana-Craze-Boosts-Value-to-100-per-Item-in-Digital-Trading-Spotlight-on-Steam"><a href="#Banana-Craze-Boosts-Value-to-100-per-Item-in-Digital-Trading-Spotlight-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Banana Craze Boosts Value to $100+ per Item in Digital Trading Spotlight on Steam"></a>Banana Craze Boosts Value to $100+ per Item in Digital Trading Spotlight on Steam</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Virtual bananas in a new viral game are being traded for real money on Steam, with rare items fetching hundreds or thousands of dollars.</li><li>The “Banana” community on Discord creates unique banana designs that users can collect in-game and trade on the Steam Community Market.</li><li>There has been some skepticism around the game’s true intentions, though many players seem to see it as a meme.</li></ul><p> Steam’s latest clicker game sensation has users trading virtual bananas on the Steam Community Market for hundreds of real-world dollars. Just what is going on?</p><h2 id="This-Game-Is-Bananas"><a href="#This-Game-Is-Bananas" class="headerlink" title="This Game Is Bananas"></a>This Game Is Bananas</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" >Banana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free clicker game that has taken the Steam charts by storm. The extent of the “gameplay” involves clicking an on-screen banana, which admittedly isn’t dissimilar to <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-lava-agni-2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >other types of clicker games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Every three and 18 hours, you’ll get given an in-game item in the form of a banana.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ss_641d6402187d5335b1e345498f0eff293a054f75-1920x1080.jpg"                      alt="A virtual banana from the Banana game on Steam."                > </p><p>Pony &#x2F; Sky &#x2F; AestheticSpartan</p><p> These bananas are random drops designed by the game’s community on Discord, with varying degrees of rarity. There are bananas that look like 3D meshes, bananas that look like games of pong, bananas with pandas and cats on them, and so on.</p><p> These in-game items may be given out for free, but they can be traded on the Steam Community Market for real money. You can buy and sell bananas from as little as a few cents up to hundreds or thousands of dollars. The rarer the banana, the higher the value the community has assigned to it.</p><h2 id="What’s-Really-Going-On-Here"><a href="#What’s-Really-Going-On-Here" class="headerlink" title="What’s Really Going On Here?"></a>What’s Really Going On Here?</h2><p> Because of the game’s popularity, the perceived value of rare bananas has increased sharply. Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=2923300" >Banana Community Market <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see what prices bananas are currently selling for.</p><p> At the time of writing, Banana is the third most-played “game” on the Steam platform, only beaten by <em>Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. The most expensive used item is the “Crypticnana” of which there are only 25 in existence. Current prices range from around $800 to $1800. Gaming peripheral manufacturer Razer has also gotten in on the action, with Razer-branded bananas selling for around $65.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-12-at-12-32-52.png"                      alt="The free-to-play Banana game in third place on the Steam charts."                > </p><p> It’s still a bit of a mystery what’s really going on here. The game makes no claims that in-game items have any inherent value so on the surface, Banana seems innocent enough. The game doesn’t appear to be doing anything in the background (so it’s not a stealthy crypto miner), and you don’t even need to leave it open as long as you open it regularly for a few clicks to collect your fruit.</p><p> PC Gamer’s Harvey Randall <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/banana-a-game-where-you-rapidly-click-on-a-jpeg-of-a-banana-and-nothing-else-has-an-all-time-peak-of-31124-players-on-steamheres-why/" >conceded <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “what surprised me most was a lack of genuine sketchiness.” TheGamer’s Tessa Kaur takes a different tone, <a class="link"   href="https://www.thegamer.com/that-viral-banana-game-is-an-obvious-and-shockingly-successful-grift/" >citing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a lot of bot activity, a (now removed) team member’s history with a pump-and-dump scheme, and obscured drop rates that mean “developers can manually generate ultra rare bananas for themselves or their friends.”</p><p> For most, the game appears to be a meme rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. There’s a single Steam Achievement to earn, which is unlocked with your first click. An update added Steam Workshop support, so users can now submit bananas and potentially make some revenue from them though there’s no guarantee an item will be accepted.</p><hr><p> Skepticism doesn’t seem to have dampened Steam’s appetite for Banana, and the vast majority of items are worth little more than a few cents. One Steam Community <a class="link"   href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2923300/discussions/0/6513974885817933637/#c4552659424068864577" >member <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sums it up neatly: “Technically I made 0,30$ for free. Yeah. I mean it’s stupid, but you just have to let the game open in the background… No need to click anything so I jumped in lmao.”</p><p> To learn more about the game, head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://discord.gg/thebanana" >Banana Discord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The mini3 by DDPai is unique among the dashboard cams we’ve tested because its primary function is as a social media and photography device, rather than as a basic security camera for your car. The picture quality was the best among the car cams we reviewed and is by far the most stylish and discreet. What really makes it stand out is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dash-cams-vs-dash-cam-apps-534883" >mobile app, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which adds a social media element that makes owing this device a lot of fun.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-21st-Century-Dashcam"><a href="#Design-21st-Century-Dashcam" class="headerlink" title="Design: 21st Century Dashcam"></a><strong>Design: 21st Century Dashcam</strong></h2><p> The first thing you notice about the mini3 is that the camera housing is smooth and cylindrical. Other dash cams are very square and bulky, so right out of the box, you know this is a different kind of camera. It’s very sleek and feels like it belongs in the 21st century.</p><p> The way the dash cam attaches to your windshield is also unique. Instead of a suction cup or dash mount, the mini3 has a specially-designed bracket that you slide the camera module into. The mount goes behind your rearview mirror so it is all but invisible to you while you drive. That’s a big contrast from the other models we tested that must be put somewhere within your field of view.</p><p> The DDPai mini3 has 32GB of onboard storage, so there’s no need to worry about changing microSD cards and keeping track of adapters.</p><p> It can achieve this ultra-low profile because it has no display. Instead, it uses your smartphone as the display via its mobile app, which means you’re required you to have a mobile device to use it.</p><p> The DDPai mini3 has 32GB of onboard storage, so there’s no need to worry about changing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >microSD cards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and keeping track of adapters. You can review your footage and manage your memory directly in the mobile app and through the computer. It’s good to have one less part to keep track of.</p><p> It’s also the only dashcam we tested that’s wireless, generating its own Wi-Fi network to connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other mobile devices. This is really convenient because anyone that has the app can access the camera so long as they’re in the immediate vicinity of the car. Just remember to rename the Wi-Fi network and change the password for security reasons.</p><p> Like other dashcams we’ve reviewed, the mini3 comes equipped with a G-sensor and motion detection abilities. This allows it to act as a security guard for your car when you’re parked and as video backup in you’re ever in a traffic accident (although the Smart Parking Mode, which records while you’re parked, requires you to invest in DDPAI’s hard wire kit).</p><p> Another unusual feature is the ability to take still photography as you’re driving. The dashcam comes with a nifty remote control that’s shaped like an oversized bottle cap. If you see something you want to take a picture of, like a nice bit of scenery, push the remote’s button and the camera takes an extremely high-quality snapshot for you. You can also set it to take up to 30 seconds of video.</p><p> One of the downsides of this device is that it doesn’t allow you to adjust its loop recording feature. Other dash cams we tested let you choose to set the recordings at one, three, or five-minute intervals. With the mini3, all loop recordings are 1:37 seconds.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest downside to this dash cam is the fact that there is no battery, meaning it must be plugged into power at all times to record.</p><p> Another drawback is the sound. While it is by far the best sound recording quality we’ve encountered in a dashcam, it was often out of sync with what was happening on the screen.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest downside to this dash cam is the fact that there is no battery, meaning it must be plugged into power at all times to record. You have to buy a separate battery pack if you want to use the parking guard feature.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Read-the-manual-first"><a href="#Setup-Process-Read-the-manual-first" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Read the manual first"></a><strong>Setup Process: Read the manual first</strong></h2><p> The user manual for the DDPAI mini3 is detailed enough that you’ll know what everything does and how to use it. It starts you off by prompting you to download the app, which will walk you through the process of connecting to the camera’s Wi-Fi and give you a tour of its features. After that, you’re ready to go—it only takes about 10 minutes to be comfortably familiar with the mini3.</p><p> The most complex part is installing the power cable since you have to conceal the wire inside your car’s roof and side panels. DDPai has a<a class="link"   href="http://en.ddpai.com/product/mini/3.html" >good tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on how to do this, and the camera comes with all the necessary tools right in the box (something lesser cameras lack).</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mobile-App-What-sets-it-apart"><a href="#Mobile-App-What-sets-it-apart" class="headerlink" title="Mobile App: What sets it apart"></a><strong>Mobile App: What sets it apart</strong></h2><p> What really sets the mini3 apart from other dashcams is its mobile app. The user manual instructs you to download the DDPai app before you use the camera for the first time. Once it’s on your phone and paired with your camera, the app’s “Camera” tab contains all the tools you need to watch the live feed, control the camera, review footage, and adjust settings—all the things that make a car cam useful.</p><p> The “Camera” tab also gives you the ability to do basic video edits like trim and crop footage. This is also where you can download any of the loop recordings you want to keep from being overwritten when the 32GB card gets full.</p><p> However, it’s the organizational tools and social media features that make the mini3 more useful and fun than any other dashcam we reviewed. The app’s “On the Road” tab contains a very basic social media experience that allows you to browse videos and pictures that people have shared from all over the world. There are posts from users in many different countries, which is great if you love to travel or just want to see beautiful and candid views of places you’ve never been.</p><p> The app’s “Albums” tab is where you can find and organize all the photos and videos that you take with the remote. In our testing, the video we captured played back in jaw-dropping quality. It also provided interesting statistics for the timeframe it captured, like how many left turns you took, how many times you changed lanes, accelerated, and decelerated. It even goes into detail about the g-forces on the car and the slope of the road you’re driving on.</p><p> The “Profile” tab is where you can set up an account to share your own driving experiences with the world. This isn’t necessary to use the camera or browse other people’s posts, but it’s a really unique social network—try trading Twitter for a week and see which one is more fun!</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="701707">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-701707">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fappsumo.8odi.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F701707%2F7443'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/701707/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-4K-video-with-incredible-detail"><a href="#Camera-Quality-4K-video-with-incredible-detail" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: 4K video with incredible detail"></a><strong>Camera Quality: 4K video with incredible detail</strong></h2><p> True to the promise of its design, the camera is par excellence. It can capture footage in 4K resolution as well as 1600p using an f&#x2F;1.8 aperture that lets in more light. That, along with the camera’s high-capacity processor and image sensor, yields eye-popping detail, richness, and clarity. It is by orders of magnitude the highest-quality picture we’ve seen among the dashcams we’ve tested.</p><p> It can capture footage in 4K resolution as well as 1600p using an f&#x2F;1.8 aperture that lets in more light.</p><h2 id="Performance-Always-there-for-you"><a href="#Performance-Always-there-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Always there for you"></a><strong>Performance: Always there for you</strong></h2><p> Once it was installed and ready to go, we drove this dashcam through the cities, suburbs, mountains, forests, and red rocks of Utah. Because the camera is so well-hidden behind the rearview mirror, we often forgot it was there. But when we passed a particularly scenic lake or rock formation, it was natural to just reach down and push the remote button to snap a picture.</p><h2 id="Price-Surprising-low-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Surprising-low-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Surprising low for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Surprising low for what you get</strong></h2><p> As of the time of this writing, you can pick up the DDPAI mini3 for about $130. For what you get out of this camera, we think this is a great value. Similarly-priced models we tested don’t nearly match the quality and utility you get from the mini3.</p><h2 id="Competition-DDPAI-mini3-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-DDPAI-mini3-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition :DDPAI mini3 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition</strong> :<strong>DDPAI</strong> <strong>mini3 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We also tested the mini3 alongside the Z-Edge Z3 Plus, which is a similarly-priced dashcam with more of a focus on security.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and boxy compared to the more stylish form of the mini3. It has an integrated three-inch view screen with physical controls, so you do not have to have a smartphone or tablet to access its most useful features. And although the quality of the picture is excellent, it’s nowhere near as detailed or clear as the mini3’s. But it does have collision detection and a “parking mode” that automatically records motion around your car like a security camera (without the extra hard-wiring kit that the mini3 requires).</p><p> In the end, these two dashcams serve slightly different purposes—if you want a device that’s strictly intended to document what happens to your vehicle as a form of protection, then the Z-Edge model is a good fit. But if you’re a frequent road-tripper who wants some fun extra features for recording your travels, then you’ll probably get a lot of enjoyment out of the mini3.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A surprisingly fun dashboard camera that’s perfect for people who want to share their adventures.</strong></p><p> If you’re a road-tripper, travel vlogger, or plugged-in social media user, then the DDPAI mini3 is made for you. Not only is this dashcam stylish and discreet, it also captures beautiful photos and video of your travels that are perfect for sharing or simply saving to revisit down the road.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apeman-c450-review-4770598" >Apeman C450 Dashcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049383/7443" target="_top" id="2049383">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049383" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049383/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dash Cam mini3</li><li>Product Brand  DDpai</li><li>MPN  6934915 200726</li><li>Price  $100.99</li><li>Weight  2.5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.7 x 2.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Platform  iOS, Android</li><li>Camera  Captures at 1600p, f&#x2F;1.8 Aperture, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  Up to 4K resolution</li><li>Connectivity options  Wi-Fi, USB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-deciphering-dji-phantom-3s-flight-instruments-and-controls/"><u>[New] Deciphering DJI Phantom 3'S Flight Instruments and Controls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-future-visionary-premium-blu-ray-players-selection-for-2024/"><u>[New] Future Visionary Premium Blu-Ray Players Selection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-tailored-macos-tutorials-for-editing-srt-files-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Tailored macOS Tutorials for Editing SRT Files for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-artists-blueprint-10-tips-for-podcast-cover-success/"><u>[Updated] The Artist's Blueprint 10 Tips for Podcast Cover Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/comprehensive-explanation-of-googles-automatic-transcription-technology/"><u>Comprehensive Explanation of Google's Automatic Transcription Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-any-vivo-y78-5g-phone-password-using-emergency-call-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock Any Vivo Y78 5G Phone Password Using Emergency Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-transform-your-videos-into-revenue-streams-with-smart-vimeo-tactics/"><u>In 2024, Transform Your Videos Into Revenue Streams with Smart Vimeo Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/on-the-go-wifi-solution-tp-links-miniature-trv902-ac-travel-router/"><u>On-the-Go WiFi Solution: TP-Link's Miniature TRV902 AC Travel Router</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/razer-book-13-review-pint-sized-powerhouse/"><u>Razer Book 13 Review: Pint-Sized Powerhouse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/redefining-smartwatches-with-lg-watch-style-a-closer-look-at-wear-os-20-innovations/"><u>Redefining Smartwatches with LG Watch Style: A Closer Look at Wear OS 2.0 Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/roku-vs-amazon-fire-tv-stick-comprehensive-guide-on-choosing-the-best-streaming-device/"><u>Roku vs Amazon Fire TV Stick -

It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> Generous cutouts allow for easy access to all ports, and vents on the bottom of the case help to maintain airflow and keep your computer from overheating. Fintie offers a number of color and style options, from the Vintage Leather look that we tested to playful graphic prints and sleek solid colors.</p><p> It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> The synthetic leather provides a comfortable grip, and that meant a great deal to us when we were assessing the overall utility of the case. It’s comfortable to walk around with it in your hands, and there’s enough traction in the synthetic leather to keep it from slipping in most cases. The Fintie also offers a host of other color and style options to allow for a little customization.</p><p> One more plus? Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin. It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer. And the case doesn’t interfere with your use of the laptop at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oLEmxLNytxQINRktM9nWjKfhTZ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4153328-4-ec18ce2eec6b4e73853f562114489d01.jpg"                      alt="Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Hayley Prokos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896510/19272" target="_top" id="1896510">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896510" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896510/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No instructions needed"></a><strong>Setup Process: No instructions needed</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve unwrapped this product, there’s no need to read any instructions—the case requires little setup.

Only Fintie combines plastic and premium synthetic leather to create such a low-profile case.</p><p> It depends on how tight your budget is—there are other cheaper options, but the lower the price, the more you may notice a decline in quality. The Fintie Protective Case is something of an anomaly in that you actually get more than you pay for.</p><p> Need some more help finding the perfect laptop case? Check out our list of the best MacBook Pro cases on the market today.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An affordable case that fits laptops better and provides more protection than the competition.</strong></p><p> The Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13 is neither flimsy nor ill-fitting and is made from premium materials. If you want a case that protects your computer from scratches, dings, and the overall impact of minor drops, this one will certainly meet, if not exceed, your expectations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105867/7443" target="_top" id="2105867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105867/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pro-level-screen-recorder-showdown/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pro-Level Screen Recorder Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-listening-out-loud-deciphering-the-differences-between-podcasts-and-youtube/"><u>[New] Listening Out Loud Deciphering the Differences Between Podcasts & YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-tiktok-engagement-using-zoom-features-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boosting TikTok Engagement Using Zoom Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-spark-inspiration-free-premium-designs-for-video-marketers/"><u>[Updated] Spark Inspiration Free, Premium Designs for Video Marketers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-craft-humorous-memes-with-giphy/"><u>2024 Approved Craft Humorous Memes with Giphy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-evolved-2023-samsung-bd-j5900-a-deep-dive/"><u>2024 Approved The Evolved 2023 Samsung BD-J5900 A Deep Dive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/low-cost-lenovo-chromebook-duet-unveiled-in-our-comprehensive-product-evaluation-the-perfect-compact-hybrid/"><u>Low-Cost Lenovo Chromebook Duet Unveiled in Our Comprehensive Product Evaluation - The Perfect Compact Hybrid</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/low-profile-powerhouse-unveiling-the-versatile-acer-aspire-c27-desktop/"><u>Low-Profile Powerhouse: Unveiling the Versatile Acer Aspire C27 Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/mastering-monster-mayhem-inside-look-at-challenging-creatures-in-monster-hunter-world/"><u>Mastering Monster Mayhem: Inside Look at Challenging Creatures in Monster Hunter: World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/mophie-powerstation-ac-unit-testing-expensive-yet-highly-practical-charging-solution/"><u>Mophie Powerstation AC Unit Testing: Expensive Yet Highly Practical Charging Solution</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use"></a><strong>Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use</strong></h2><p> It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car. You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter"><a href="#Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter" class="headerlink" title="Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter"></a><strong>Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter</strong></h2><p> You can find this model available online for between $70 and $75, and at that price point it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size. There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you? If it’s worth the extra $10, stick with the DBPOWER 600A. If not, you can pick up the Beatit BT-D11 for a bit less money and otherwise get a strikingly similar unit.</p><p><strong><em>Aickar Car Jump Starter:</em></strong> Between these two it’s almost too close to call. While the Aickar costs a mere few dollars less, it also has better output current for more reliable jump starts. For that reason alone, the DBPOWER 600A falls just a little short.</p><p> Interested in checking out more options?

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models. A few common design elements can be found in the speaker grill, fans, and PreadtorSense software, but the design is otherwise distinct.</p><h2 id="Display-Better-than-first-glance"><a href="#Display-Better-than-first-glance" class="headerlink" title="Display: Better than first glance"></a>Display: Better than first glance</h2><p> I wasn’t immediately impressed by the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s display. It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> There’s one downside: poor viewing angles. This is unusual in a modern laptop, though I’ve noticed this trait in many high-refresh laptop displays. I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657395/16446" target="_top" id="1657395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657395/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

It’s responsive and rejects any quick, unintended brush by a palm or thumb. It’s smooth when using multi-touch gestures like two-finger scroll or pinch-to-zoom.</p><h2 id="Audio-Packing-a-punch"><a href="#Audio-Packing-a-punch" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Packing a punch"></a>Audio: Packing a punch</h2><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts. Maximum volume is loud enough to fill an office with music and overcome most ambient noise. There’s even a hint of bass that you’ll feel through your fingertips when the volume is cranked up.</p><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help. It has Intel’s Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 and let me tell you: this thing rips.</p><p> It delivered network speeds of over 800 megabits per second (Mbps) near my router, which is typical. Every<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345#:~:text=Wi%2DFi%206%20is%20the,Fi%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable." >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop I review manages that. I was impressed by its performance in my detached office, where the Triton 300 SE hit up to 195Mbps. By comparison, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-5179212" >Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hit only 40Mbps in the same space.</p><p> This translated to excellent real-world results. I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><h2 id="Software-Planet-what-now"><a href="#Software-Planet-what-now" class="headerlink" title="Software: Planet what now?"></a>Software: Planet what now?</h2><p> Acer ships the Predator Triton 300 SE with Windows 10 Home. It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925544/19272" target="_top" id="1925544">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925544" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925544/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-perfecting-voiceovers-in-filming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide Perfecting Voiceovers in Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-boosting-your-videos-chance-on-vimeo-staff-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] Boosting Your Video's Chance on Vimeo Staff List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-precision-in-perspective-mastery-of-youtube-video-degrees/"><u>[Updated] Precision in Perspective Mastery of Youtube Video Degrees</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/beantech-bitwatch-s1-plus-smartwatch-evaluation-an-intriguing-affordable-tracker/"><u>Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch Evaluation: An Intriguing Affordable Tracker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/classic-elegance-meets-modern-design-skagens-falster-2-the-refined-rival-of-the-iconic-iphone/"><u>Classic Elegance Meets Modern Design: Skagen's Falster 2 - The Refined Rival of the Iconic iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-ispoofer-on-motorola-edge-40-neo-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use iSpoofer on Motorola Edge 40 Neo? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/navigate-with-ease-top-wireless-mouse-options/"><u>Navigate with Ease: Top Wireless Mouse Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-camera-not-working-unexpected-error-fix-it-now-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ Camera Not Working Unexpected Error?

The game begins with the character you’ll play as waking up in a panic. Someone will narrate everything that’s going on to you, including what the area around you looks like. After a short introduction, you’ll be prompted to pick what you want to play as: Glaive, Jack, or Nano. These will roughly translate into someone more physical, someone mixed physical and magical, and a mage, but of course, set in this strange half-fantastical, half-science-fiction world where everything is new and unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b1_d8ikgtdkSH_Y0F510q_BXpK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-03-d99b43959fa74b31a15f336852f14d75.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> This whole introduction is slow moving and boring, and getting through it is rough. But even past this, things don’t necessarily pick up and get more interesting. The game has such a heavy hand with its narration, telling you the game’s visuals even though you can see them right there on your screen. The whole game reads like someone wrote a novel, couldn’t publish it, and then decided making a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a better idea, and instead of trimming the fat, they left every unnecessary description and detail in the game’s prompt.</p><p> I did continue forward, even though I was already disinterested, hoping the game would become more gripping. After the memory room, you’ll wake to another platform where a being tells you you’ve suffered a great injury and they are in your mind. He tries to explain who you are but before he gets too far, you’ll be attacked by something called the Sorrow. Eventually, you’ll wake in the real world, enter the game’s main city, and be able to talk to the wealth of characters living there. You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><p> You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134241/18498" target="_top" id="2134241">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134241" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134241/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort"><a href="#Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort</strong></h2><p> The Tides of Numenera is a third-person<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-offline-rpg-games-4177675" >role-playing game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where almost 75 percent of the gameplay is scrolling dialogue boxes and the various prompts that will pop up as the game tells you the story.

Every action you take will prompt you to use effort. This effort allows for your character to work harder at the chosen action, and thus gives your character a better chance of accomplishing their goal.</p><p> This system is set in place in an attempt to allow you some control over which tasks you want to prioritize with effort―but understand that a lot of the game is built around failure. The game even tells you as much in the introduction. Failing doesn’t mean you’ve messed up, it just means you’ll be set on a different course of the game’s story. Really, I never felt this mechanic offered more than giving players a false sense of control. In reality, the effort prompts didn’t feel like they added much to the overall gameplay experience, they certainly didn’t add any much needed excitement.</p><p> Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> The inspiration aspect is probably the game’s most interesting gameplay mechanic. While you are exploring the world and speaking to characters, you’ll sway them depending on the various prompts. This alignment system will affect the story and what prompts become available for your character. Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> Overall, this game was a weak attempt at offering players the experience of a novel in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> format. The storytelling is very heavy-handed. The writing is weak and full of repeated telling of things you can easily see on-screen around you. There’s little to no direction about where to go or what exactly you should be doing, and combined with the long paragraphs of text, things becomes boring fast. The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way. It’s just a shame that it gets buried under such heavy, inactive storytelling.</p><p> The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated and simplistic"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated and simplistic</strong></h2><p> Tides of Numenera was created in 2017―however, you wouldn’t know this if you jumped into the game and made a guess based upon the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics look more like they’re stuck in the early 2000s, with blocky, almost pixelated characters. There is some forgiveness to be had because the game isn’t focused on the visuals―it’s more about the words and the story. But there is a limit to how forgiving one can be considering the game isn’t that old.</p><p> The one positive is the originality in the world the developers have created. The setting feels unique―a mix of strange alien tech within a fantasy city. A wide range of characters will fill the game, and they respond and react in creative ways. It’s also a fun experience to run around and talk to these various characters and explore the game’s world and the lore of Numenera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfXjCwwtXMVBL58JZmix5sR3vBQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-04-7f9c8617b9cd41738ad2ac02abf0aec9.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918714/19272" target="_top" id="1918714">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918714" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918714/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story"><a href="#Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story"></a><strong>Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story</strong></h2><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an expensive game, costing $50 on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-steam-games-4176308" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it’s not on sale. It’s a game created with a very specific type of player in mind―and I suspect most people are not going to like it.</p><p> That said, if role-playing games with a text-heavy focus are of interest to you, then the game does have a lot to offer for the cost. The world of Numenera is vast, and considering all the prompts that alter the story, the game also has a lot of replayability. While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else, and for those players, the $50 cost will be worth it.</p><p> While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs"><a href="#Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other story focused RPGs"></a><strong>Competition: Other story focused RPGs</strong></h2><p> There are quite a few other games available that are story-focused RPGs besides Tides of Numenera. Wasteland 2 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-2-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-4/dp/B013CQHQFU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a very similar game, as it is made by the same developers, but where Numenera falls flat with its heavy-handed storytelling, Wasteland 2 stands apart with a fun, tactical combat system.</p><p> Another third-person RPG that will have a great and well-developed world to explore is Pillars of Eternity (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Eternity-Complete-PlayStation-4/dp/B0734T77S2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The game will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world and its huge dungeon, and while still rich in story, won’t bog you down to the point of boredom. The last game I’ll recommend looking at is any of the Mass Effect titles. Mass Effect does a great job of building a rich science-fiction world while also giving the player a story filled story-altering choices and decisions.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A text-heavy RPG that doesn’t live up to its predecessor.</strong></p><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game focused on creating an experience that is more novel than video game. The storytelling is text heavy, but the world is rich and unique, mixing sci-fi and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the unique world wasn’t enough to carry me through the outdated graphics and boring gameplay.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Torment: Tides of Numenera</li><li>Product Brand  inXile Entertainment</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>ESRB Rating  M for Mature</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, MaxOS,Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-ecological-architecture-merging-nature-and-city-planning/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ecological Architecture Merging Nature and City Planning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-blur-out-not-your-photos-top-10-edits-to-fix-fuzziness/"><u>[New] Blur Out, Not Your Photos!

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136617/26400" target="_top" id="2136617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136617/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 - F&#x2F;4</li><li>Focus  Manual Focus 8mm to infinity</li><li>Field of vision  34 degrees</li><li>Resolution  640 x 480; 12 MP claimed, 0.31 MP tested</li><li>Frame rate  30fps</li><li>What’s Included  Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-creating-captivating-slideshows-on-the-social-media-giant/"><u>[Updated] Creating Captivating Slideshows on the Social Media Giant</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-arena-of-games-100plus-channel-spectrums-galore/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Arena of Games 100+ Channel Spectrums Galore</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comparing-ipad-pro-and-microsoft-surface-pro-key-distinctions/"><u>Comparing iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro: Key Distinctions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-digital-camera-reviewed-quality-vs-expectations/"><u>Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Digital Camera Reviewed: Quality Vs.

channel</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home.

The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users.

Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >Wide Area Network (WAN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port to ensure you’re ready for the fastest home broadband connections.</p><p> One disappointing aspect of Netgear’s newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cjLjOjMRWQJm5An87vAXSv1ZALw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbiAX6000-01f5a284913b44099978b706c3a3fa79.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi AX6000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/orbi-whole-home-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review-5069596" >Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u36wLJKd2jTPAgvkVuGxo2A8P4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-3865cd2d845349a78c533b0b397df43b.jpg" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 AX6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >$282 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/447452455" >$282 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1541979-REG/asus%5Fxt8%5Fb%5F2%5Fpk%5Fzenwifi%5Fac%5Fwhole%5Fhome%5Ftri%5Fband.html" >$350 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of advanced features</li><li>Parental and security controls</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> Although Asus’ AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company’s ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further. It’s a “mesh-first” system that works right out of the box to give you maximum coverage and performance throughout your home with minimum fuss. The Asus mobile app makes it so easy to set up you won’t even notice how much power it packs under the hood.</p><p> The ZenWifi XT8 offers cutting-edge 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 technology and packs many gaming enhancements that have become synonymous with Asus routers.

Even better, Asus’ AiMesh technology means you can easily add other Asus router models or the ZenWiFi system to your existing wired Asus router.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> AiProtection, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OVHAXIS6oyYG_3zI0cikh72G8ig=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ASUSZenWiFiAX6600-8dda0992ebd2432086abe152da110106.jpg"                      alt="ASUS ZenWiFi AX6600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Best-for-Smart-Homes"><a href="#Best-for-Smart-Homes" class="headerlink" title="Best for Smart Homes"></a>Best for Smart Homes</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >Google Nest Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/CV5RgmojhaK6mnzCK8c_kcfs6Jc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/google-nest-wi-fi-2nd-generation-a94c4c7e3d0c47a9afd3d8964caf86d8.jpg" >Google Nest Wi-Fi (2nd Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >$89 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/575491453" >$110 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Google-Nest-Wifi-Router-and-Add-on-Point-Snow-GA00822-US/311324762" >$281 at Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Attractive and simple design</li><li>Integrates with Google Home</li><li>Point units double as smart speakers</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No Ethernet ports on points</li><li>Lacks a dedicated backhaul channel</li></ul><p> Google’s Nest Wi-Fi is a straightforward mesh system that provides excellent integration features for users of Google Assistant and Google-compatible smart home devices. The second generation of Google’s mesh solution, Nest Wi-Fi’s satellite units (called “point” units) double as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smart speakers. So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.</p><p> Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >scanning a QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358" >network hub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/linksys-velop-review-powerful-mesh-router-5072402" >Linksys Velop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975636">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975636">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975636%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975636/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network"></a>What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094421/7443" target="_top" id="2094421">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094421" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094421/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire</p><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more.

You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one.

They are available in a range of models from budget-friendly to high-end.</li></ul><p> The world has moved on from 1080p, and 1440p is the new standard for mid-range PC gaming. Also known as Quad HD or QHD for short, 1440p monitors provide an affordable and attainable middle-ground between HD and 4K for most gamers.</p><h2 id="What-Is-1440p"><a href="#What-Is-1440p" class="headerlink" title="What Is 1440p?"></a>What Is 1440p?</h2><p> 1440p typically refers to a resolution of 2560x1440, and is often marketed as QHD (Quad HD) by monitor manufacturers. Some gamers refer to it as “2K” resolution, even though this isn’t strictly accurate. Though 1440p commonly refers to a single resolution, it is also sometimes used to refer to other resolutions with a maximum vertical resolution of 1440 pixels, for example, 5120x1440 as seen on super <a class="link"   href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-handheld-panorama-peacekeeper-360-stabilizer-for-2024/" >ultrawide displays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203079&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/858193/what-is-1440p-resolution-what-you-need-to-know-about-qhd/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Samsung Odyssey G9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Many monitors are marketed as 1440p or QHD displays, which means they have a native resolution of 2560x1440. Manufacturers are usually keen to differentiate other variations of 1440p using another acronym, like DQHD (dual quad HD) seen on some ultrawide displays.</p><h2 id="How-Is-1440p-Different-From-4K-or-1080p"><a href="#How-Is-1440p-Different-From-4K-or-1080p" class="headerlink" title="How Is 1440p Different From 4K or 1080p?"></a>How Is 1440p Different From 4K or 1080p?</h2><p> 1440p is a higher resolution than 1080p (1920x1080) and lower than UHD or what is commonly referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/" >4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (3840x2160). Many people think of it as a middle-ground between the two resolutions, which is why some refer to it as “2K” instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1080p_1440p.png"                      alt="1080p compared with 1440p resolution"                > </p><p> Many factors influence display quality including resolution, panel type, refresh rate, and <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-to-address-delayed-stories-on-social-networks/" >pixel density <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You shouldn’t assume that a 1440p monitor is inherently better or worse than another based purely on resolution alone. How you intend to use the monitor will influence perceived image quality too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1440p_4k.png"                      alt="1440p compared with 4K resolution"                > </p><p> For example, it’s not uncommon to find a 1440p monitor with a much higher refresh rate than a 4K counterpart, which means the 1440p model has <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/" >improved responsiveness and better motion handling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you compare a 24-inch 1440p monitor to a 1080p monitor of the same size, the 1440p model has a higher pixel density (122.3 ppi) compared to the 1080 model (91.7 ppi) which makes individual pixels harder to distinguish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977006">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977006">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977006%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977006/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="WQHD-vs-QHD-vs-2K"><a href="#WQHD-vs-QHD-vs-2K" class="headerlink" title="WQHD vs QHD vs 2K"></a>WQHD vs QHD vs 2K</h2><p> Both QHD and WQHD are often labeled as 1440p, and both refer to the same resolution of 2560x1440. The “W” here is short for “widescreen” which refers to the 16:9 aspect ratio used in 1440p displays.</p><p> So is 1440p the same as 2K resolution? That answer largely depends on what you’re doing and who you ask. 2K as a resolution is officially defined (by <a class="link"   href="https://www.dcimovies.com/" >Digital Cinema Initiatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) as 2048x1080 since 2K in this instance refers to 2000 pixels on the horizontal axis. In gaming, however, 2K has become synonymous with 1440p since the standard is commonly seen as a midpoint between 1080p and 4K.</p><p> To avoid that confusion, monitors are typically marketed either as QHD, WQHD, or 1440p instead of 2K.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-1440p-So-Popular"><a href="#Why-Is-1440p-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="Why Is 1440p So Popular?"></a>Why Is 1440p So Popular?</h2><p> According to the <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" >Steam Hardware Survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from May 2024, 18.7% of Steam gamers use a native display resolution of 2560x1440, with 58% of users still using 1080p. That makes it the second-most-popular primary display resolution, lagging 1080p by quite a margin but far more popular than 4K (3.7%).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-28-at-09-32-11.png"                      alt="Steam Hardware Survey resolution results for May 2024."                > </p><p>Valve Corporation</p><p> 1440p is well on the way to becoming the new 1080p. It’s a sizeable upgrade in overall image quality from 1080p but it doesn’t necessarily require the most powerful <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-vivo-s17-pro-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market to get smooth frame rates. If higher frame rates are a priority, 1440p yields far better performance than 4K. Many PC builds now target 1440p as a baseline resolution, up from 1080p only a few years ago.</p><p> To understand why this is, consider the demand placed on a GPU in terms of raw pixel count. You can work out how many pixels must be rendered for each frame by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel counts of a resolution together. For 4K, that’s 8,294,400 pixels in any given frame, but 1440p is less than half that at 3,686,400. For reference, 1080p is less still at only 2,073,600 pixels.</p><p> In terms of performance, this relationship isn’t linear. You won’t get double the framerate at 1440p, but you will see a significant increase. Take a look at charts on websites like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gpucheck.com/gpu-benchmark-graphics-card-comparison-chart" >GPU Check <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see how average frame rates at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K compare.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gpu_check.png"                      alt="GPU Check average FPS per GPU"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>GPU Check</em></p><p> For fast-paced games like competitive online shooters, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-professionals-playbook-merging-srt-captions-into-mp4/" >higher framerates can give you the edge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as long as your monitor has a refresh rate capable of making use of those frames. If you’re hitting a locked 120 frames per second on a monitor with a 120Hz (or better) refresh rate, you’re seeing twice the number of frames that you’d otherwise be seeing on a 60Hz monitor at 60 frames per second.</p><p> Price also keeps 4K use to a minimum, since 1440p monitors are cheaper. This is especially true if you want to push the refresh rate to 144Hz or beyond, where 4K monitors start to become prohibitively expensive for many.</p><h2 id="Can-Consoles-Use-1440p"><a href="#Can-Consoles-Use-1440p" class="headerlink" title="Can Consoles Use 1440p?"></a>Can Consoles Use 1440p?</h2><p> Both Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles are capable of outputting a native 1440p image, ideal for console gamers who like to play games on a monitor rather than a TV. Having a native output within the console settings will help games scale properly, but you shouldn’t expect performance benefits from playing on a 1440p monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2183185269.jpg"                      alt="A Sony PlayStation 5 console on a desk with a controller, headphones, and monitor."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bangkok-thailand-july-27-2022-playstation-2183185269" >Wachiwit&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, a 1440p output is generated by downscaling (or “super-sampling”) a 4K image. The Xbox Series S natively supports 1440p as its maximum resolution. PlayStation 5 owners should note that using 1440p means that <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/" >variable refresh rate (VRR) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be disabled.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Any-Drawbacks-to-1440p"><a href="#Are-There-Any-Drawbacks-to-1440p" class="headerlink" title="Are There Any Drawbacks to 1440p?"></a>Are There Any Drawbacks to 1440p?</h2><p> 1440p is a lower resolution than 4K, which means images won’t be quite as crisp or detailed at QHD compared with UHD. How sharp a monitor seems is dependent on pixel density and <a class="link"   href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-is-ipogo-not-working-on-poco-m6-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >sitting distance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, which is often a bigger factor in general desktop use. Text and UI elements are sharper at higher pixel densities, and image quality can quickly fall apart if the pixel density is too low.</p><p> You’ll get less overall screen real estate on a 1440p monitor compared to a 4K one. This means there will be less room on the screen (at native resolution) for windows and other applications at any given time. Conversely, you may find yourself <a class="link"   href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/leading-platforms-for-snagging-snapchat-soundtracks/" >scaling UI elements up in Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on a 4K display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/windows_scale_resolution.png"                      alt="Set scaling and resolution modes in Windows 11"                > </p><p> Lastly, 1440p as a resolution doesn’t scale well on a native 4K display. That is to say, if you have a 4K display and you pick 2650x1440 as your resolution, scaling will not be even. Since 4K is larger by a factor of 2.25, a resolution of 1440p will look blurry.</p><p> You should use a tool like <a class="link"   href="https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU" >Custom Resolution Utility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (CRU) for Windows to set resolutions that scale well for your display.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-a-1440p-Monitor"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-a-1440p-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy a 1440p Monitor?"></a>Should You Buy a 1440p Monitor?</h2><p> 1440p monitors provide a good balance between price, image quality, and performance. You’ll notice a big upgrade over your old 1080p display, without sacrificing the performance required for native 4K. 1440p monitors are available at all price ranges, from affordable yet performant models like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C63HDHPR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203079&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/858193/what-is-1440p-resolution-what-you-need-to-know-about-qhd/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >LG 27GR83Q-B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the ridiculous <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CZSGWLD5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203079&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/858193/what-is-1440p-resolution-what-you-need-to-know-about-qhd/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Dell Alienware AW2725DF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with its 360Hz 1440p <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/az-recorder-expert-series-app-deep-dives/" >QD-OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> panel.</p><p> Even the best-performing 1440p displays are cheaper than many native 4K panels, plus you don’t need the most powerful PC on the block to get the most out of them. This makes 1440p monitors an excellent choice for mid-range PCs that struggle to hit satisfactory (or competitive) frame rates at 4K.</p><p> You’ll get access to higher refresh rates like 144Hz, 175Hz, or 240Hz for less money. Combined with lower resolutions (and overall smaller pixel counts), this makes them a better choice for those who favor fluidity and responsiveness over the highest native pixel count possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ps5_1440p_mode.jpeg"                      alt="Selecting a 1440p output in the PS5&#39;s Settings."                > </p><p> You can use your 1440p monitor in its native resolution to play games on Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles.

If you don’t <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-upside-down-your-instagram-videos-complete-manual/" >need the highest refresh rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can score a budget 4K monitor that will tick all of the boxes for a 60 frames per second single-player experience, whether you’re playing on a PC or a current-generation console.</p><p> On top of this, you’ll get <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-instant-display-image-any-window-os-for-2024/" >more screen real estate for general desktop usage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> whether that’s work, web browsing, or creative endeavors like photo and video editing. A budget-friendly 4K display may be a better choice if you’re buying a monitor for mixed-use. It also may be a better buy if you’ve got a PC that can target 4K and you’re more likely to be playing <em>Alan Wake 2</em> or <em>Cyberpunk: 2077</em> rather than <em>Apex Legends</em> or <em>Valorant</em>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Spiderman-DLSS-3.jpeg"                      alt="A performance comparison of Spider-Man Remastered runnng with DLSS 3 on and off."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Sony &#x2F; NVIDIA</p><p> With gaming in mind, upscaling technology has come a long way. <a class="link"   href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/add-music-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/" >NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-update-iphone-xs-max-to-the-latest-iosipados-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/" >AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it possible to render whatever you’re playing at a less-than-native resolution and then upscale it to 4K with minimal loss in quality.

href="#What-to-Look-for-in-a-Steam-Deck-or-ROG-Ally-Dock" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in a Steam Deck or ROG Ally Dock"></a>What to Look for in a Steam Deck or ROG Ally Dock</h2><p> Regarding docking stations, you might be tempted to dive right in with first-party offerings, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Valve Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or the <a class="link"   href="https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/chargers-and-adapters/rog-gaming-charger-dock/" >ROG Gaming Charger Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While these are both undoubtedly excellent options, they’re not exactly the most cost-effective, and depending on what you’re looking to gain from your docking station, you may find they are lacking in certain areas.</p><p> For instance, if you’re simply looking to connect your handheld to a big-screen TV or gaming monitor, you may not need an abundance of USB ports on your dock. However, if you want to repurpose your Steam Deck or ROG Ally into a gaming PC, you will want a docking station that can accommodate peripherals, such as a mouse and keyboard, for extra versatility.</p><p> Selecting a dock that can support 100W power delivery will benefit a more full-fat setup, as you’ll be able to provide power to all your add-on devices without diminishing your overall gaming experience. You might want to consider a docking station with more premium features, such as an M.2 SSD slot, which will give you acres of convenient storage space to play with.</p><p> Features such as Ethernet ports will provide a more stable connection for online play, while a hub with DisplayPort capabilities will allow you to set up multiple displays simultaneously. Whatever kind of docking station you’re looking for, we’ve got the lowdown right here to help you choose the best option for your handheld PC.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts who have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It has six ports, including HDMI 2.0 (supporting 4K output at 60Hz), Gigabit Ethernet, one USB-C port, plus two USB-A ports for peripheral devices. And if that’s not enough to wet your whistle, it also has an M.2 slot for SSD storage.</p><p> Incorporating built-in NVMe SSD support into the design of this docking station is, frankly, a stroke of genius. Simply docking it gives you up to 4TBs of expandable storage for your console. It also eliminates the need to constantly cycle through your library of downloaded games, swapping them out and deleting them to make room for your current faves.</p><p> The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station also supports 100W power delivery, so there’s enough juice to power your Steam Deck at full charging speed. It also offers data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, so you can enjoy a fast and reliable gaming experience with this powerful hub, especially when using a Gigabit Ethernet connection.</p><p> With a price tag just shy of $90, the JSAUX M.2 Docking Station won’t be for everyone. However, it has everything you need for a great time with your Steam Deck, and the bonus of SSD storage support makes it more akin to using a conventional desktop PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jsaux-m-2-docking-station-tag.png"                      alt="JSAUX M.2 Docking Station TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Steam Deck Dock Overall</p><h5 id="JSAUX-M-2-Docking-Station-1"><a href="#JSAUX-M-2-Docking-Station-1" class="headerlink" title="JSAUX M.2 Docking Station"></a>JSAUX M.2 Docking Station</h5><p>The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station is ideal for leveling up your Steam Deck gameplay, with its integrated M.2 SSD slot, super-fast data transfer speeds, and plenty of ports for connecting your gaming peripherals.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Ports-HB0604-Included/dp/B0BNTQWKN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$90 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="The-Official-Steam-Deck-Dock-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station"><a href="#The-Official-Steam-Deck-Dock-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station" class="headerlink" title="The Official Steam Deck Dock: Steam Deck Docking Station"></a>The Official Steam Deck Dock: <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/valvew-steam-deck-dock.png"                      alt="Valve Steam Deck Dock"                > </p><p>Valve</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Firmare updates vis SteamOS</td><td>✗ Expensive</td></tr><tr><td>✓ FreeSync VRR support</td><td>✗ Not compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Includes power adapter</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you might expect, Valve’s official <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is tailor-made for Steam Deck owners. It offers a seamless experience for the Steam Deck, supporting a dual-display setup (up to 4K at 60Hz or 1440p at 120Hz), firmware updates, and even its own power adapter.</p><p> It comes equipped with at least three USB-A 3.1 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0, though sadly, no USB-C port is included here. It provides multi-monitor support, FreeSync VRR support for external monitors, and firmware updates via SteamOS.</p><p> This first-party docking station is the perfect match for your Steam Deck, boasting an impressive build quality and a feature-rich design. Made from the same materials as the Steam Deck, it acts as a natural extension of your handheld in terms of its look and functionality.</p><p> On the downside, which is no great surprise, the Steam Deck Docking Station isn’t compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally. Being the official docking station for Valve’s handheld, you’ll need to look elsewhere if you’re a ROG Ally owner. Plus, you might be better off looking at more cost-effective alternatives if you’re shopping on a budget.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/valve-steam-deck-dock-tag.png"                      alt="Valve Steam Deck Dock TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Official Steam Deck Dock</p><h5 id="Valve-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station-1"><a href="#Valve-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station-1" class="headerlink" title="Valve Steam Deck Docking Station"></a>Valve Steam Deck Docking Station</h5><p>The official Valve Steam Deck Docking Station is the perfect companion for your Steam Deck, offering a range of connectivity options, with firmware updates delivered directly from SteamOS.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >See at Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-ASUS-ROG-Ally-Dock-Overall-UGREEN-Steam-Deck-Dock"><a href="#Best-ASUS-ROG-Ally-Dock-Overall-UGREEN-Steam-Deck-Dock" class="headerlink" title="Best ASUS ROG Ally Dock Overall: UGREEN Steam Deck Dock"></a>Best ASUS ROG Ally Dock Overall: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Docking-Foldable-Ethernet-Compatible/dp/B0CR6JND4M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >UGREEN Steam Deck Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ugreen-steam-deck-dock.png"                      alt="UGREEN Steam Deck Dock"                > </p><p>UGREEN</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Supports ROG Ally Turbo Mode</td><td>✗ Can run a little hot sometimes</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Keeps cooling vents free from obstruction</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Integrated SD&#x2F;TF slot</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> There are plenty of third-party docking stations that can accommodate both the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, but the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Docking-Foldable-Ethernet-Compatible/dp/B0CR6JND4M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >UGREEN Steam Deck Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one that, despite its name, stands out as one of the best options for ROG Ally owners.</p><p> This 9-in-1 docking station offers exceptional versatility, with 4K support at 60Hz, 10Gbps data transfer speeds, and 100W fast charging.

Its discreet, space-saving design won’t cause any undue cable clutter on your desk or near your TV.</p><p> On the downside, this charger dock is rather expensive for what it is, and it does lack a Gigabit Ethernet port. Its comparative lack of features may prove off-putting to some, particularly those who want as much versatility as possible from their charging dock. However, for those who are eager to invest in the official option, this is a sleek customer that performs well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rog-gaming-charging-dock-tag.png"                      alt="ROG Gaming Charging Dock TAG"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Official ASUS ROG Ally Dock</p><h5 id="ROG-Gaming-Charger-Dock-1"><a href="#ROG-Gaming-Charger-Dock-1" class="headerlink" title="ROG Gaming Charger Dock"></a>ROG Gaming Charger Dock</h5><p>The official charging station for the ASUS ROG Ally, the ROG Gaming Charger Dock offers big-screen display support at 4K, with super-fast charging to boot.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/chargers-and-adapters/rog-gaming-charger-dock/" >See at ASUS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Dock-SABRENT-6-Port-Docking-Station"><a href="#Best-Budget-Dock-SABRENT-6-Port-Docking-Station" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Dock: SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station"></a>Best Budget Dock: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Docking-Station-Devices-DS-SD6P/dp/B0BTJYY8MD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sabrent-6-port-docking-station.png"                      alt="SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station"                > </p><p>Sabrent</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Affordable</td><td>✗ Not as feature-rich as some more premium options</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Plenty of space for additional devices</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Compatible with both Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> At first glance, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Docking-Station-Devices-DS-SD6P/dp/B0BTJYY8MD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> looks rather unassuming. Similar in design to the <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Valve Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it has a sleek and minimalist look that lacks a bit of visual flair. Nevertheless, it’s compatible with the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, offers six ports (including three USB-A and two USB-C), supports 4K resolution (with a 60Hz refresh rate), and costs less than $30.</p><p> With three USB-A ports, this dock is ideal for hooking up additional devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, to turn your handheld into a mini gaming desktop. The Type-C ports (something that the official Valve option lacks) can be used for power delivery or external storage, while the HDMI port allows you to use a secondary display, such as a TV or monitor.</p><p> It’s versatile enough to be compatible with other USB-C devices and provides a sturdy non-slip base on which it can be placed. It also supports PD 3.0 with up to 95W charging speeds, meaning that your device can be charged quickly while docked.</p><p> The Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station will appeal to anyone who loves the look of the Valve Steam Deck Docking Station but doesn’t want to pay the premium asking price for the official model. And while it lacks the bells and whistles of the Valve Dock, it still represents excellent value for money, with enough features to satisfy many Steam Deck (or ROG Ally) fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sabrent-6-port-docking-station-tag.png"                      alt="SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station TAG"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none;

It packs neatly into any bag or backpack and makes docking your ROG ally or Steam Deck a cinch when you’re on the move.</p><p> The Syntech Mini Dock has been designed with a rounded base, providing good stability when docking your handheld. Thanks to its sturdier foundation, you don’t need to worry about your console tipping over, despite this dock’s smaller size. It has six ports, including an HDMI 2.0 port (which supports up to 4K at 60Hz), three USB-A ports for external devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and USB-C. </p><p> The docking station features anti-slip grips inside the console cradle so that your device holds its position, and a gripped pad on the bottom of the dock keeps it firmly rooted to your table or desk. As another handy quality-of-life feature, it can accommodate most protective cases, so you won’t need to remove these before docking your device.</p><p> The Syntech Mini Dock is ideal for anyone who likes to travel on their Steam Deck or ROG Ally and is looking for a stable and effective space-saving dock that won’t break the bank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/syntech-mini-dock-tag.png"                      alt="Syntech Mini Dock TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Compact Dock</p><h5 id="Syntech-Mini-Dock-1"><a href="#Syntech-Mini-Dock-1" class="headerlink" title="Syntech Mini Dock"></a>Syntech Mini Dock</h5><p>Thanks to its space-saving circular design, the Syntech Mini Dock is one of the best options available for gaming on the go with your Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$39 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="How-do-I-connect-my-Steam-Deck-or-ROG-Ally-to-a-TV"><a href="#How-do-I-connect-my-Steam-Deck-or-ROG-Ally-to-a-TV" class="headerlink" title="How do I connect my Steam Deck or ROG Ally to a TV?"></a>How do I connect my Steam Deck or ROG Ally to a TV?</h3><p> To connect your Steam Deck or ROG Ally to your TV, you’ll need to connect a USB-C hub or USB-C to HDMI cable to your TV (with the HDMI end), with the USB-C end plugged into your console. </p><p> With your TV on, select the corresponding HDMI input option and make sure your Steam Deck or ROG Ally is switched on.

It also has the advantage of running Windows 11 (compared to Steam Deck’s SteamOS, which runs on Linux) which gives you access to other storefronts. </p><p> In contrast, the Steam Deck offers a marginally better battery life, and arguably provides the best tactile experience, with its precision trackpad and more familiar button array.

I love playing RPGs like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy on my smartphone when I’m waiting in a government building or otherwise, somehow, forgot to bring any of my handheld devices with me, but as soon as you need to play an action game, things fall apart.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/anbernic_rg35xx_h.jpg"                      alt="Anbernic RG35X H portable handheld retro gaming console."                > </p><p>Anbernic</p><p> Now, modern smartphones happily work with most modern game controllers, and there are accessories like the <a class="link"   href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/grundkurs-deutsch-aufbauend-bis-100-in-der-deutschen-zahlenreihe/" >Backbone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/visualizing-your-vision-incorporating-new-fonts-into-after-effects/" >Kishi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that will turn your phone into a pseudo-handheld console, but it’s all a bit of a hassle. My <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/RG353VS-Handheld-Console-Bluetooth-RG353VS-Transparent/dp/B0BPCQRYPX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003054&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/reasons-retro-gaming-handhelds-are-better-than-a-phone-app/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Anbernic RG353VS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and other consoles like it, however, offer a single unified design with everything you need. The controls, the screen, the speakers, everything is ready to go within a second of turning the device on.</p><p> Despite the screen being much smaller than my phone’s, I think the smaller screens might actually look better. There’s no scaling required, and the smaller size makes everything look crisp.</p><h2 id="Longer-Battery-Life"><a href="#Longer-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Longer Battery Life"></a>Longer Battery Life</h2><p> Despite their large batteries, if you use a modern phone for retro emulation, you’ll find that the percentage meter runs down rather quickly. The games might be rather basic, but emulation of even relatively old video game systems still uses a fair amount of CPU power. That’s not including the power draw of the screen being on for long stretches of time!</p><p> A modern emulation handheld can often provide you with all-day gaming thanks to smaller screens, low-power CPUs, a large battery relative to the rest of the device, and no additional jobs like internet communications or Bluetooth to eat up those precious Watts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="No-Battery-Anxiety"><a href="#No-Battery-Anxiety" class="headerlink" title="No Battery Anxiety"></a>No Battery Anxiety</h2><p> On a related note—there’s no battery anxiety with a dedicated handheld. The worst that can happen if your handheld runs out of juice is that you won’t be able to play video games for a while. If your phone dies, well that’s a small-scale disaster and can actually leave you in a pretty dangerous situation. So, at the very least, keeping a dedicated emulation handheld around means you don’t have to worry about your gaming habit causing any real inconvenience to you or anyone else who needs to stay in touch with you.</p><h2 id="Malware-Privacy-and-Ads-are-Irrelevant"><a href="#Malware-Privacy-and-Ads-are-Irrelevant" class="headerlink" title="Malware, Privacy, and Ads are Irrelevant"></a>Malware, Privacy, and Ads are Irrelevant</h2><p> I won’t go into details here, but sometimes emulation on a mobile phone involves <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-nuance-the-human-advantage-over-bots/" >sideloading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or downloading stuff that could put your phone at risk of a malware infection. Apart from that, emulator apps themselves might gather data you don’t want them to, or bombard you with annoying ads.</p><p> On a dedicated handheld that’s a non-issue. If your handheld console gets infected with malware somehow, well who cares? It only has games on it, and it’s not connected to anything important. Just don’t plug it into something critical!</p><p> You also don’t have to connect it to the internet, if it even has that option. Except if you want to update its software occasionally.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="It-Has-a-Headphone-Jack"><a href="#It-Has-a-Headphone-Jack" class="headerlink" title="It Has a Headphone Jack!"></a>It Has a Headphone Jack!</h2><p> Headphone jacks are all but kaput on modern smartphones, and most Bluetooth headsets have annoying amounts of latency when it comes to gaming. Seeing the sound effects play a second after you see it happen on screen gets old fast. Sure, you can connect wired headphones to your phone with a dongle, but that’s still less convenient than using the old-school jack on a dedicated emulation handheld.</p><p> There are lots of good, affordable handheld emulation systems on the market, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Pre-Installed-Supports-Bluetooth-Streaming/dp/B0BGC1R75N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003054&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/reasons-retro-gaming-handhelds-are-better-than-a-phone-app/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Anbernic RG353VS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I use, the popular <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Console-3-5-inch-3000mAH-Endurance-Battery%EF%BC%8C/dp/B0CS3SDF7V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003054&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/reasons-retro-gaming-handhelds-are-better-than-a-phone-app/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Miyoo Mini Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or the Premium <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Analogue-Pocket-Transparent-Game-Boy-Color/dp/B0CL123S88/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003054&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/reasons-retro-gaming-handhelds-are-better-than-a-phone-app/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Analog Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Curved TVs haven’t caught on in a big way, given that the vast majority of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >4K HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sets sold today are still flat. Still, curved-screen sets are out there if you want something a little different, or perhaps something that provides a supposedly more immersive viewing experience. These days, Samsung is really the only brand-name manufacturer still pumping out new curved sets in North America, with a range of sizes and prices available.</p><p> Samsung’s 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is on the lower end of that price scale, with an MSRP of $550, but seen on sale for less than $500. It’s a sharp-looking set, given the high-resolution 4K image, and the curved design is appealing—although it comes with the same set of limitations and complications as any curved TV screen.</p><p> Lacking brightness holds it back a bit, minimizing the effect of HDR, but this is still a pretty nice set for the price, assuming that you’re fixated on a curved screen. I tested Samsung’s RU7300 for more than 80 hours across streaming media, video games, movies, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LtRcWBwD090kcd6bXSRbOUiTiLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_02-2035b246c96446388cc49504b68842ba.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-An-appealing-arc"><a href="#Design-An-appealing-arc" class="headerlink" title="Design: An appealing arc"></a><strong>Design: An appealing arc</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a bit more visual pop than your average<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >large-screen 4K HDR set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because it is physically popping out towards you on the right and left sides, unlike a standard flat television. It’s a subtle curve overall, but enough to be just noticeable—especially from the sides. That might make it an awkward fit for wall mounting, but it has a distinctive edge that’s unlike nearly every other TV you’ll find in stores.</p><p> Curves aside, Samsung went pretty minimal on the front of the set, with a black plastic frame that’s nearly uniform around the screen—but slightly thicker on the bottom, with a tiny Samsung logo sitting on a small metallic accent at the center. The two legs strike a wide stance on either end, and aren’t especially chunky.</p><p> Meanwhile, the back of the TV has a series of uneven ridged horizontal stripes that are attractive. You’ll find the array of ports here, split between two panels. There are three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an optical audio out, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and hybrid component&#x2F;AV cables for older devices. That should be plenty for your various devices, although some TVs around this price point pack in another<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The included remote control is compact, but filled with all of the buttons you’ll need to navigate menus, tap in channel numbers, and reach your favorite streaming services. It has dedicated buttons for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video right on the remote, plus there are four programmable, color-coded A-D buttons for favorite channels. The TV itself also has a small control nub underneath the Samsung logo, but it’s difficult to feel around for and use.</p><p> Low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall"><a href="#Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Legs or wall"></a><strong>Setup Process: Legs or wall</strong></h2><p> If you’re setting the Samsung RU7300 up on a stand or table, then you’ll need to install the legs. That is extremely straightforward: each is designated for a certain side and simply requires popping in and tightening a couple of screws. Meanwhile, if you opt for wall-mounting, you’ll need a standard VESA 200x200 mount—however, you may need longer screws. The screws on my existing wall mount (for a flat-screen TV) weren’t long enough, so I had to order specialized ones.</p><p> Initial software setup can take a few minutes, as you’ll be prompted to log into a Wi-Fi network if you don’t have an Ethernet cable plugged into an active connection, and you may have to download updates to Samsung’s built-in interface. It was a pretty quick process for me.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder</strong></h2><p> At 3840x2160 (4K Ultra HD) resolution, Samsung’s RU7300 has sharpness covered, delivering crisply detailed visuals across the board. Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly. And low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><p> Samsung advertises HDR support here, but it doesn’t pack quite the same punch as on some other TVs in this price range. This curved set just doesn’t get immensely bright, so it’s difficult to see quite as much variance in the dynamic range. Watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 4K, it’s still inherently vibrant due to the source material, but lacks the extra edge in dynamism and contrast, and even looks a bit dim at times. The image quality isn’t bad in any way, but it doesn’t hit quite the peaks that I’d expected.</p><p> As for the curved design, it’s difficult to really see the advantages beyond wanting something a bit different from the pack. Whether playing games or watching movies or TV shows, I didn’t feel like the picture was any more immersive due to the slight arc of the display. But the curved screen does bring some notable downsides, such as ambient light more clearly reflecting off of the curves, and viewing angles suffering at wider angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GaFmEEESPt4pM-0PAQ3JifVZPOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_03-e3e60b2553d84a6cb6a03c52a94073a0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Totally solid sound"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Totally solid sound</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a pair of stereo speakers with a total output of 20W, and they’ll get the job done for everyday viewing of streaming shows and movies, and playing games. Playback is clear and full, although it’s not heavy on bass—and unlike a lot of other modestly-priced televisions, I wasn’t immediately itching for a soundbar. You’ll see an improvement from external speakers, certainly, but it doesn’t feel as necessary here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948905/19272" target="_top" id="1948905">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948905" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948905/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Clean-but-incomplete"><a href="#Software-Clean-but-incomplete" class="headerlink" title="Software: Clean, but incomplete"></a><strong>Software: Clean, but incomplete</strong></h2><p> Samsung’s own<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tizen-4580383" >Tizen OS-based <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Smart Hub interface is used on this curved smart TV, providing easy access to streaming video apps and settings. Most of the heavy hitters are here, either already installed or available via the built-in app marketplace, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and even<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193" >Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are some omissions, however: both Twitch and Bravo were missing in action when I searched for them. Samsung also offers a number of free streaming channels in partnership with Pluto TV, in case you miss the sensation of flipping channels for something to watch.</p><p> Even with some popular apps missing, the interface is very clean and easy to use, taking up only a small chunk of space at the bottom of your screen when hunting for your next app so you can still see what you were already watching or playing. Sponsored ads for streaming video channels and newly-released movies might be annoying to some users, however.</p><p> Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly.</p><h2 id="Price-Curves-cost-extra"><a href="#Price-Curves-cost-extra" class="headerlink" title="Price: Curves cost extra"></a><strong>Price: Curves cost extra</strong></h2><p> There aren’t many curved televisions currently on the market, so it’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison. However, looking at other mid-range 4K HDR Smart TVs with flat screens, you can find numerous models for less cash than the $550 asking price of the RU7300. Still, the RU7300 has been selling for around $480 as of this writing, which is easier to stomach if you’re set on a curved screen.</p><h2 id="Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV"><a href="#Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV" class="headerlink" title="Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV"></a><strong>Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV</strong></h2><p> Here’s one example of how you can save a fair amount of cash by skipping the curved screen—and get a better TV in the process. Vizio’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-50-inch-4k-smart-tv-m507-g1-review-4842757" >M-Series Quantum 50-inch 4K HDR TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-50-class-led-m-series-quantum-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr/6345462.p?skuId=6345462" >Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a little smaller in size, sure, but not significantly so. Better yet, it delivers a brighter and more vibrant picture, with local dimming zones boosting the black levels.</p><p> They’re not significantly far apart in overall quality, but with the Vizio set priced at $400 and seen on sale for less, it shows that lower-priced sets can actually be an upgrade over this curved option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-48-inch-tvs-4138374" >Hisense 50H8F Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The curve isn’t essential, but it’s a solid mid-range TV if you can find it on sale.</strong></p><p> If you’re sold on a curved screen, whether it’s due to the distinctive nature or purported added level of immersiveness, then the Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is a pretty good mid-range choice. It’s more expensive than similarly-specced flat 4K HDR sets, but that’s the price you’ll pay for a significant niche feature. Samsung’s curved set comes up a little short on brightness, which impacts the quality of the HDR experience, but otherwise provides a nice-looking picture, responsive inputs, and a slick-looking interface.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132160/7443" target="_top" id="2132160">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132160" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132160/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  UN55RU7300FXZA 55-Inch 4KUHD 7 Series</li><li>Product Brand  Samsung</li><li>Price  $500.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2019</li><li>Product Dimensions  48.7 x 28.1 x 4.1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Resolution  3840x2160</li><li>HDR  Yes</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, 2x USB, Component Video, Optical, Coaxial, Ethernet, A&#x2F;V</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-expertsnap-recording-tool-win-10-version/"><u>[New] ExpertSnap Recording Tool, Win 10 Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-your-windows-photos-feed-incorporating-audio-elements/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Your Windows Photos Feed Incorporating Audio Elements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Huawei Nova Y71 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/1723088299053-comprehensive-review-of-the-razer-book-13-a-mini-beasts-bite/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Razer Book 13 – A Mini Beast's Bite!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-infinix-smart-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Infinix Smart 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Unova Stone Pokémon Go Evolution List and How Catch Them For Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prank-your-friends-easy-ways-to-fake-and-share-google-maps-location-on-infinix-zero-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Prank Your Friends!
