If you’re frustrated about that, don’t worry! There are plenty of other music streaming services out there that still let you sing along. Let’s dive into the best free music streaming services that still offer lyrics support.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136615/26400" target="_top" id="2136615">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136615" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136615/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Lyrics-Are-Important-For-A-Streaming-Music-Service"><a href="#Why-Lyrics-Are-Important-For-A-Streaming-Music-Service" class="headerlink" title="Why Lyrics Are Important For A Streaming Music Service"></a>Why Lyrics Are Important For A Streaming Music Service</h2><p> There are countless times I’ve tried singing along to music without the right lyrics. It feels terrible. Lyrics allow us to connect deeply with the music, understand the artist’s message, and belt out those high notes with confidence. They turn casual listening into a full-on karaoke session, whether you’re alone or with friends.</p><p> Lyrics aren’t just fun; they’re essential for non-native speakers and those with hearing impairments. They make music more inclusive, ensuring everyone can enjoy and understand the words behind the beats. It’s like having a translator and a storyteller wrapped into one.</p><h2 id="Great-Alternatives-to-Spotify-That-Still-Offer-Free-Lyrics-Support"><a href="#Great-Alternatives-to-Spotify-That-Still-Offer-Free-Lyrics-Support" class="headerlink" title="Great Alternatives to Spotify That Still Offer Free Lyrics Support"></a>Great Alternatives to Spotify That Still Offer Free Lyrics Support</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6b0ab20a.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Music app on the Pixel 7"                > </p><p>Hannah Stryker &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> With Spotify paywalling lyrics, we have to find something else to scratch that karaoke itch.

It offers an extensive library of music videos, live performances, and user-generated content. You can search for songs by lyrics, making it super easy to find and sing along to your favorites.</p><p> Despite the ads on the free tier, YouTube Music still supports lyrics for many tracks. Not all songs have lyrics, but the availability is pretty good. Plus, you can access it on the web, iOS, and Android platforms, so it’s pretty flexible. There are a lot of lyric music videos on the platform as well for a complete karaoke experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Deezer"><a href="#Deezer" class="headerlink" title="Deezer"></a>Deezer</h3><p> Next up is Deezer, a service that offers lyrics for many tracks in its vast library.

Pandora offers personalized radio stations and access to lyrics, making it a great alternative. The service also includes Pandora Stories, which add more context to your favorite tracks.</p><p> The free tier has some limitations, like fewer skips and ads, but it still provides lyrics support. Pandora is available on web, iOS, and Android, ensuring you can listen and sing along wherever you are.</p><h2 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Spotify"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Spotify?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Spotify?</h2><p> There’s always some leeway when it comes to determining the best of anything. Everyone has their preferences, and each of the alternatives has pros and cons to their free tier.</p><p> You should look at what the alternatives have in terms of coverage and availability. Make sure the service you pick works seamlessly across all your devices. Whether you’re using a smartphone, tablet, or web browser, compatibility is key to a smooth listening experience. Some services offer seamless switching, allowing users to go between a web interface and mobile without interruption.</p><p> If you change, the biggest thing to get used to will be the user interface. Look for a service with easy navigation and a clean layout. A great interface will make discovering new music and managing playlists a joy rather than a chore.</p><hr><p> Spotify’s choice to shut free users out of lyrics is a bad deal. Luckily, you’re not stuck being forced to pay for the service. There are more than a handful of alternatives that still offer lyrics as part of their free tier. While Spotify is the most popular service, it’s far from the only one you can use. Maybe it’s time to show them that cutting lyrics from the free tier was a terrible mistake.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-expert-advice-for-eliminating-youtube-video-skip-teasers/"><u>[New] Expert Advice for Eliminating YouTube Video Skip Teasers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-vision-to-reality-personal-animation-mastery/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Vision to Reality Personal Animation Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-turn-your-videos-into-a-revenue-stream-with-these-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Turn Your Videos Into a Revenue Stream with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-elite-audio-upgrades-the-creme-de-la-creme-sound-cards-of-the-2024-market/"><u>Discover Elite Audio Upgrades: The Crème De La Crème Sound Cards of the 2024 Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-your-inner-adventurer-the-incredible-compact-camera-sx70/"><u>Discover Your Inner Adventurer: The Incredible Compact Camera SX70</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/download-the-ultimate-list-of-15-free-windows-11-themes-here/"><u>Download the Ultimate List of 15 Free Windows 11 Themes Here!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/echo-pop-or-echo-dot-understanding-the-key-differences/"><u>Echo Pop or Echo Dot – Understanding The Key Differences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/elysian-estates-transforming-simple-nests-into-grand-homes/"><u>Elysian Estates: Transforming Simple Nests Into Grand Homes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-insights-into-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-your-ally-for-personal-fitness-goals/"><u>Expert Insights Into the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active: Your Ally for Personal Fitness Goals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-review-the-strongly-built-uniden-r3-with-exceptional-long-range-features/"><u>Expert Review: The Strongly Built Uniden R3 with Exceptional Long Range Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/free-mov-video-orientation-changers-top-rated/"><u>Free MOV Video Orientation Changers Top Rated</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-make-the-most-of-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-lock-screen-with-notifications-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Make the Most of Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Lock Screen with Notifications? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-from-google-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Guide from Google FRP Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/repairing-windows-camera-failure-on-photovideo-saving/"><u>Repairing Windows Camera Failure on Photo/Video Saving</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <title>Enhanced Listening Experience: Spotify Restores Lyric Display for Non-Premium Members</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhanced-Listening-Experience-Spotify-Restores-Lyric-Display-for-Non-Premium-Members"><a href="#Enhanced-Listening-Experience-Spotify-Restores-Lyric-Display-for-Non-Premium-Members" class="headerlink" title="Enhanced Listening Experience: Spotify Restores Lyric Display for Non-Premium Members"></a>Enhanced Listening Experience: Spotify Restores Lyric Display for Non-Premium Members</h2><p>Spotify recently limited access to lyrics for accounts without Spotify Premium, which seemed like an especially silly move to boost paid subscriptions. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like it worked, because Spotify has now just reverted the measure.</p><p> Spotify has reversed its decision to <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-top-ios-psp-games-and-emulators-revealed-in-2024/" >restrict lyrics access for free users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, reinstating unlimited viewing of song lyrics for everyone. The streaming giant had previously limited some free Spotify accounts to viewing lyrics for only three songs per month. That move, as you might imagine, wasn’t all that popular. It felt like an arbitrary, unnecessary crippling of Spotify’s in-app experience in an attempt to get more users to subscribe. Now, though, the measure has been reversed. The restriction was part of a test that will not roll out to everyone.</p><p> Responding to the criticism, a Spotify spokesperson stated, “At Spotify, we’re always testing and iterating. This means availability of our features can vary across tiers and between markets and devices. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be expanding Lyrics availability for Spotify Free users so more people can enjoy viewing more lyrics, globally.”</p><p> The decision to reinstate full lyrics access aligns with CEO Daniel Ek’s recent announcement during the company’s earnings call, where he emphasized plans to enhance the free user experience. Ek highlighted that upcoming improvements would be based on existing performance in certain markets, indicating a data-driven approach to optimizing the free tier.</p><p> This reversal suggests that Spotify has actually listened to user feedback and is prioritizing user satisfaction over pushing premium subscriptions. Another possibility is that the feature wasn’t really translating into new subscriptions, so there wasn’t a point in the added negative attention created by removing the feature for free accounts. Spotify also still has stiff competition from Apple Music and other similar services that it has to worry about.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-lyrics-are-back-for-free-users-175200293.html" >Engadget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-captioning-techniques-for-professional-youtube-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, Captioning Techniques for Professional YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-kickstarting-your-digital-voice-the-complete-process-of-starting-a-youtube-chanel/"><u>[Updated] Kickstarting Your Digital Voice The Complete Process of Starting a YouTube Chanel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-master-the-art-of-message-interaction-on-desktopmobile/"><u>[Updated] Master the Art of Message Interaction on Desktop/Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-world-of-video-timestamps-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating the World of Video Timestamps on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-powerhouse-apple-ipad-air-2020-compares-favorably-with-the-ipad-pro/"><u>Budget-Friendly Powerhouse: Apple iPad Air (2020) Compares Favorably with the iPad Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/cellular-network-not-available-for-voice-calls-on-nokia-xr21-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls On Nokia XR21 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discover-the-premier-smartwatch-selection-available-this-year/"><u>Discover the Premier Smartwatch Selection Available This Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-microsoft-flight-simulator-x-gold-edition-remains-a-top-choice-in-aviation-gaming/"><u>Expert Analysis: Microsoft Flight Simulator X - Gold Edition Remains a Top Choice in Aviation Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/exploring-the-rich-tapestry-of-medieval-times-with-assassins-creed-valhalla-a-detailed-critique/"><u>Exploring the Rich Tapestry of Medieval Times with Assassin's Creed: Valhalla – A Detailed Critique</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/finding-the-perfect-blend-of-affordability-and-performance-in-ibuypowers-custom-gaming-systems-a-detailed-review/"><u>Finding the Perfect Blend of Affordability & Performance in iBUYPOWER's Custom Gaming Systems - A Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-old-music-from-your-google-pixel-fold-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>How to recover old music from your Google Pixel Fold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/huawei-mediapad-m5-examined-the-ultimate-visual-and-audio-experience/"><u>Huawei MediaPad M5 Examined: The Ultimate Visual & Audio Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-hitman-trilogy-finale-evaluation/"><u>In-Depth Hitman Trilogy Finale Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/metamorphose-into-the-metaverse-an-easy-avatar-guide/"><u>Metamorphose Into the Metaverse An Easy Avatar Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/tail-chat-live-fun-camera-experience-with-furry-friends/"><u>Tail Chat Live: Fun Camera Experience with Furry Friends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-mystery-a-comparison-of-speed-between-chatgpt-4-and-chatgpt-35/"><u>Unraveling the Mystery: A Comparison of Speed Between ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Discovery, and Fox have been working on a new sports streaming service called Venu Sports. Those plans are now on hold, as a federal judge has paused the service’s launch with an injunction in favor of Fubo TV.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-great-debate-final-cut-pro-vs-lumafusion-for-video-editing/" >Venu Sports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was announced as a streaming service with access to many live sports channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Fox, FS1, TNT, TBS, and others, with <a class="link"   href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/resolved-issue-addressed-persistent-app-failures-for-wot-blitz-users/" >initial pricing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of $42.99 per month. Venu Sports also planned to include on-demand content from the three company’s libraries (like ESPN’s <em>30 for 30</em>). It could potentially allow many people to drop their traditional TV packages, since live sports coverage is one of the few remaining reasons to pay for TV over streaming services.</p><p> Fubo TV, a TV streaming service primarily targeted at sports streaming, launched a lawsuit immediately after Venu Sports was announced. Fubo accused the service of violating antitrust law, stating that Disney, Fox, and Warner already charge Fubo “as much as 30%-50%+ higher than rates they charge other distributors” for access to channels. The companies also force Fubo to include non-sports channels in packages intended for watching sports. A theoretical Venu Sports service wouldn’t have to pass on those extra distribution costs to customers, undercutting Fubo and other similar TV services.</p><p> United States District Judge Margaret M. Garnett granted an injunction in Fubo’s favor, preventing Venu Sports from launching, at least temporarily. The statement explains, “if the JV [the Venu Sports joint venture] is allowed to launch, it will be the only option on the market for those television consumers who want to spend their money on multiple live sports channels they love to watch, but not on superfluous entertainment channels they do not. And the JV’s corporate owners—the JV Defendants—are the same players that used their longstanding bundling practices to create the void in the pay TV market tailor-made for the live-sports-only JV to fill, and also exercise near-monopolistic control over the ability for a different live-sports-only streaming service to exist and compete with the JV.”</p><p> Fubo celebrated the injunction, saying in a press release, “Fubo’s goal is to ensure a competitive sports streaming marketplace that offers consumers choice, affordable pricing, flexibility and innovation. All distributors should have the opportunity to compete in a fair market, according to Fubo.”</p><p> This is only a temporary injunction, and Fubo’s lawsuit against Disney, Fox, and Warner is still ongoing with no confirmed court date.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Wins-Preliminary-Injunction-Against-The-Walt-Disney-Company-FOX-Corp.-and-Warner-Bros.-Discoverys-Venu-Sports-Joint-Venture/default.aspx" >Fubo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68276963/290/fubotv-inc-v-the-walt-disney-company/" >Court Listener <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24222035/venu-sports-disney-fox-wbd-blocked-court-antitrust" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-expert-tactics-for-effortless-collage-making/"><u>[New] Expert Tactics for Effortless Collage Making</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-screencapturepro-review-expert-insights-and-comparisons/"><u>[New] ScreenCapturePro Review Expert Insights and Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-must-try-top-5-mac-streaming-applications/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Must-Try Top 5 Mac Streaming Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-maximizing-your-network-with-the-netgear-ex3700-wi-fi-extender-ac750/"><u>Expert Analysis: Maximizing Your Network with the Netgear EX3700 Wi-Fi Extender (AC750)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-insight-on-why-the-new-apple-ipad-air-2019-is-a-game-changer-in-digital-entertainment/"><u>Expert Insight on Why the New Apple iPad Air (2019) Is a Game-Changer in Digital Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/generating-funny-images-through-adobe/"><u>Generating Funny Images Through Adobe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-motorola-g24-power-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 9 Best Free Android Monitoring Apps to Monitor Phone Remotely For your Motorola G24 Power | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/quick-tips-accessing-effective-help-resources-within-windows-10/"><u>Quick Tips: Accessing Effective Help Resources Within Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/syma-s111g-rc-helicopter-review-the-ultimate-low-cost-choice-for-home-flight-fun/"><u>Syma S111G R/C Helicopter Review: The Ultimate Low-Cost Choice for Home Flight Fun</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-ideal-beginners-choice-nokia-31-smartphone-evaluation/"><u>The Ideal Beginner's Choice: Nokia 3.1 Smartphone Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/top-8-gold-text-wonders-in-the-vast-world-of-3d-sites-for-2024/"><u>Top 8 Gold-Text Wonders in the Vast World of 3D Sites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/top-tp-link-archer-c80-speed-test-the-ultimate-guide-to-under-100-routers/"><u>Top TP-Link Archer C80 Speed Test: The Ultimate Guide to Under-$100 Routers</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Though Sony panels are sometimes on the expensive end of the spectrum, there are some older Sony 4K TVs that can be had for a nice little discount. One such TV is Sony’s XBR65X850F from their X850F series. This specific model has now been replaced by the X850G, but that doesn’t mean you necessarily need to go with the most current model. In fact, snagging one of these earlier generation sets can save you some cash without forcing you to compromise too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Standard-Sony"><a href="#Design-Standard-Sony" class="headerlink" title="Design: Standard Sony"></a><strong>Design: Standard Sony</strong></h2><p> The XBR65X850F’s design is a combination of sleek and workmanlike. The stand on this Sony is pretty common for TVs these days, with two V-shaped feet that stick out to either side. While they look aluminum, these are actually plastic too, with merely an aluminum finish. They are decently steady, but we noticed a bit of wobble if you move the TV around. It should be plenty sturdy for most, though you will need a fairly wide stand for them to rest on since they stick out so far. There’s also no room for adjusting the unit up or down, but they’re tall enough to fit a soundbar underneath if you want. They also flip open on the top if you want to use them for some clever cable management.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v7wi7isxu06LAoWNZK3dJ908mCk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-4-cb1a370bd78244b383c802010a570313.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> The rear panel is entirely matte black plastic. It’s pretty basic, but you also won’t be staring at the back of your TV a whole lot either. On the left you’ll find the power cable all by its lonesome, with the rest of the inputs and ports on the right. These are split between a hub facing the right side of the unit, and another cluster that stick straight out the back. This might be annoying if you want to get the TV super close to a wall, but the main ports most people will be using are found on the right side anyway.</p><p> If you really hate the stand you’re in luck, because also found on the back here is a VESA compatible mount for placing the TV on a wall. The XBR65X850F uses a VESA 300x300 mount, so make sure you get the right size.</p><p> On the front of the screen, the bezels are a little thicker than some of the 4K TVs we’ve reviewed, but they’re pretty thin and shouldn’t distract.</p><p> Sadly, it seems like a lot of manufacturers are minimizing controls on the TVs themselves, including Sony. Sony’s opted to use the same three-button layout found on all their current units, which work fine in a pinch, but are annoying as heck if you actually need to use them for anything other than powering the TV on or off.</p><p> The included remote is pretty standard for all Sony TVs, which means it’s big and packed with functionality. You can quickly set favorites with the hotkeys, access settings, change inputs, perform basic functions, and even manually enter channel numbers. We quite prefer this type of remote to something like a minimal Apple TV remote with only a sliver of the features. You’ve also got quick access to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> right on the remote to perform some basic functions.</p><p> On the front of the screen, the bezels are a little thicker than some of the 4K TVs we’ve reviewed, but they’re pretty thin and shouldn’t distract. There’s your standard anti-glare coating found on the screen here too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151858/7443" target="_top" id="2151858">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151858" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151858/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Stick-to-the-on-screen-instructions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Stick-to-the-on-screen-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Stick to the on-screen instructions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Stick to the on-screen instructions</strong></h2><p> Setting up pretty much any modern-day smart TV is an easy process, so just stick to the on-screen instructions and you’ll be golden. Go ahead and unpack it all, tear off that plastic film, plug in the power cable, and turn on the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vvIZMf3BNAr8JmiDAVdv4o3ceHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-2-7eabd63fb6c0415ab75fd927d664a841.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> Sony has done a solid job here of making the setup process simple, or maybe we should be thanking Google for that, as this is an Android TV. All you need to do is follow along with the on-screen instructions and complete them as necessary. Using the remote, you’ll be prompted to choose a language, location, internet connection, sign into accounts, etc. Just stick to the guide.</p><p> With the initial process done, you will likely need to run a quick update check. This should automatically pop up, but check under the settings tab if it doesn’t. An update to the firmware should improve things considerably, especially if you need to upgrade to the latest version of Android TV. Updating takes a bit of time to do, so maybe go watch some TV while…oh right. Well, whatever you do during this process, just remember not to unplug the power while it’s running through updates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Impressive-4K-for-IPS-with-some-shortcomings"><a href="#Image-Quality-Impressive-4K-for-IPS-with-some-shortcomings" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Impressive 4K for IPS with some shortcomings"></a><strong>Image Quality: Impressive 4K for IPS with some shortcomings</strong></h2><p> This section is perhaps the most important for a TV, and while the XBR65X850F performs pretty well in some aspects here, it also has a few weak points.</p><p> Starting off with some of this unit’s strengths, this particular series uses an IPS panel for the screen, which means you’re going to get vibrant colors, a nice backlight for viewing in bright rooms, and excellent viewing angles. This all adds up to a superb experience if you’ve got a big living room that’s brightly lit by windows, where viewers might not be able to sit completely centered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r5reh9LkA7QvieX1JzBg5J8qNjY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-5-00a73edbf91c48c6aa2718ab211f2e5d.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> However, IPS panels are notoriously bad for black uniformity and backlight bleed, which can cause clouding around the edges. We found this to be the case on our XBR65X850F, and while not unusable, it’s probably not the best option for viewing in dark environments because of this. The TV does have solid gray uniformity however, with no dirty screen effect. This is a huge boon if you’re a big sports fan.</p><p> Contrast is a bit disappointing. With a native contrast ratio of 894:1, the X850F series performs poorly in dark scenes, even worse when watching in a dark room.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an area where the XBR65X850F gets decent marks, but isn’t implemented quite as well as on as newer Sony TVs with brighter screens. The HDR palette here is just average, and while most people should find it adequate, it’s far from best in class.</p><p> For color calibration, it’s not great right out of the box, but this can be adjusted considerably if you’re willing to spend some time tweaking the settings. The best thing to do is to look up a calibration guide online for your specific model. We always recommend this to maximize your viewing experience. Color gamut is slightly above average in this series as well, so while some super saturated scenes might not be perfect, they’re pretty close.</p><p> Lastly, let’s take a look at motion blur and response times for the XBR65X850F. This particular Sony does very well in this area thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. While watching some fast-paced action scenes and playing games in 4K, we didn’t notice any real ghosting or stutters. This means your content should be nice and buttery smooth. However, there isn’t an option for variable refresh tech like FreeSync here, so the TV won’t be the best for gaming (though it is perfectly fine for this, bolstered by that high refresh rate). Response time here is another strength, as the XBR65X850F is very fast in this department.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vRvHMYGCPPg8nNrLBKdXwLPfwzg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-3-9f0e77e7fa1d4533877316afb591cc71.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Loud-but-distorted"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Loud-but-distorted" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Loud, but distorted"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Loud, but distorted</strong></h2><p> Built-in speakers are never going to be great, but they’re nice to have if you’re lacking an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/connect-tv-to-external-audio-system-1846816" >external sound system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like a soundbar. While we’d recommend getting an external setup for the best experience, let’s take a quick look at what the XBR65X850F has to offer with the included setup.</p><p> Right off the bat, this TV can get quite loud and you shouldn’t run into any volume issues. That being said, the overall experience is mediocre at best. The louder you turn it up, the more distortion is added. These speakers should suffice in quiet environments if you’re primarily looking for nice clear dialogue with treble and mid, but the bass is not so good.</p><h2 id="Software-A-bit-sluggish-but-good-enough"><a href="#Software-A-bit-sluggish-but-good-enough" class="headerlink" title="Software: A bit sluggish but good enough"></a><strong>Software: A bit sluggish but good enough</strong></h2><p> Android TV has come a long way since its debut, but not all TVs are getting timely updates, and these lower-end Sony TVs are notoriously slow for this. While some TVs are already running Android TV 9.0, many are stuck with older versions.</p><p> The overall experience with our XBR65X850F wasn’t awful, but it’s far from perfect. For starters, the UI is pretty hectic, with lots of content being shoved in your face. Thankfully this variant is ad-free, so no worries there (unlike<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216" >Roku <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Despite the somewhat crowded interface, you do have an amazing amount of apps, games and other content since this is connected to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-play-1616720" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is perhaps the biggest strength of the software, as well as the interconnectivity with your Google account. You’ve also got handy access to Google Assistant. The assistant can provide you with info on the fly or even perform some basic functions. It isn’t something you’ll use all the time, but it works very well and is nice to have included.</p><p> This series uses an IPS panel for the screen, which means you’re going to get vibrant colors, a nice backlight for viewing in bright rooms, and excellent viewing angles.</p><p> Browsing through the interface, we did find it to be a bit laggy and choppy at times, which can be quite frustrating. Hopefully, this can be fixed down the line when new versions of Android TV make their way to the device.</p><p> One last thing, your phone can also be used as a remote if you so choose. All you need to do is download the app and connect it to the TV. This works with both Android and iOS devices (thanks Google). While it’s not a good as the regular remote, it works fine enough if you’re too lazy to get up and find the standard remote.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902304/19272" target="_top" id="1902304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902304/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-size-but-not-the-cheapest"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-size-but-not-the-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the size, but not the cheapest"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the size, but not the cheapest</strong></h2><p> The X850F series come in a range of sizes, from 65 to 85 inches, so the prices can vary considerably depending on which one you go with. Any TV in this size range is going to cost a good bit of coin, no matter the manufacturer, but Sony isn’t too bad here.</p><p> On Sony’s website, the 65-inch model we tested here is listed at $1,300, the 75 at $2,300, and the 85 at a whopping $4,000. Now these prices aren’t exactly accurate, especially since these are an older series. Typically you can find the 65-inch for about $1,100 or so. The other models are also heavily discounted depending on where you look, so definitely shop around. It’s likely that you can snag them for even less during sales.</p><p> But how do these prices stack up against comparable TVs from competitors like LG or Samsung? Taking a quick look around online, you can easily save a few hundred dollars by going with a comparable LG TV, while Samsung was pretty closely matched with Sony. In the end, the price for the X850F series isn’t the best bang for your buck, but it ain’t bad either.</p><h2 id="Sony-XBR65X850F-vs-Samsung-UN65RU8000"><a href="#Sony-XBR65X850F-vs-Samsung-UN65RU8000" class="headerlink" title="Sony XBR65X850F vs. Samsung UN65RU8000"></a><strong>Sony XBR65X850F vs. Samsung UN65RU8000</strong></h2><p> Now there are a ton of comparable 4K TVs out there stacked up against the Sony XBR65X850F, but Samsung is a similarly reputable brand, so let’s compare their UN65RU8000 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65RU8000-Ultimate-SurgePro-6-Outlet/dp/B07Q6VCCLF?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4796693%7Cn899f0376278d4881a5af76b596b54aa000%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Alright, so each of these are 65-inch 4K TVs with similar specs, but the biggest difference is that the Sony is IPS, and the Samsung VA. What this boils down to (in a basic explanation) is that the Samsung will be a much better option for dark environments, while the Sony will excel in bright rooms. The Sony will also be a better choice if your viewing arrangement is wide and off-center.</p><p> If you’re a gamer, however, the Samsung will really shine. This is due to the inclusion of FreeSync, which allows for variable refresh rates and more consistent FPS without tearing or artifacting. In addition, it also performs better in terms of input lag and response time. The UN65RU8000 also has better blacks and a higher contrast ratio.</p><p> The prices are pretty close here, with a slight edge going to Samsung, but that may change depending on where you shop. We’d recommend the Samsung hands down for anyone looking to game on their TV, but the Sony for those with wide, spread out, bright rooms.</p><p> Still undecided? Check out our guide to the best Sony TVs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A solid IPS panel 4K TV.</strong></p><p> The X850F series is far from perfect, but the Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV and its family are more than capable of providing a pleasurable viewing experience for most people. Despite this, there are probably better options out there that can be had for even less.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV</li><li>Product Brand  Sony</li><li>Price  $1,300.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.125 x 35.5 x 12.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android TV</li><li>Screen Size  65 in.</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Ports  3 USB, 1 Digital Optical Audio Out, 1 Analog Audio Out 3.5mm, 1 Component In (shared), 1 Composite In (shared), 1 Tuner (Cable&#x2F;Ant), 1 Ethernet, 1 IR In</li><li>Speakers  2 full range, 2ch</li><li>Connectivity Options  4 HDMI</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-budget-gaming-hardware-the-ultimate-keyboard-list-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Budget Gaming Hardware The Ultimate Keyboard List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-essence-of-chuckles-in-single-photos/"><u>[Updated] The Essence of Chuckles in Single Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/achieving-optimal-configuration-windows-11-and-pc-manager/"><u>Achieving Optimal Configuration: Windows 11 & PC Manager</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-amazon-fire-hd-10-tablet-analysis-the-ultimate-family-entertainment-device/"><u>Comprehensive Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablet Analysis - The Ultimate Family Entertainment Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-television-unleashed-an-insightful-review-of-the-sony-xbr49x900fs-4k-display-and-smart-capabilities/"><u>Cutting-Edge Television Unleashed: An Insightful Review of the Sony XBR49X900F's 4K Display and Smart Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-amplify-your-youtube-audience-three-livestream-strategies/"><u>In 2024, Amplify Your YouTube Audience Three Livestream Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-review-and-guide-to-techeligible-frp-bypass-and-more-for-vivo-y100i-power-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Review & Guide to Techeligible FRP Bypass and More For Vivo Y100i Power 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-free-pptp-vpn-for-beginners-on-vivo-v27-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Vivo V27 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/intriguing-insights-into-the-portable-and-economical-samsung-galaxy-s10e/"><u>Intriguing Insights Into the Portable & Economical Samsung Galaxy S10e</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/st-sound-transformation-ultimate-10-youtube-tools-for-2024/"><u>No-Cost Sound Transformation Ultimate 10 YouTube Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-apple-watch-series-6-evaluation-refined-not-revolutionary-yet-still-unrivaled-in-quality/"><u>The Apple Watch Series 6 Evaluation - Refined, Not Revolutionary, Yet Still Unrivaled in Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-essential-guide-to-the-cyberpower-cp685avrg-how-this-simple-ups-can-secure-your-devices-and-data/"><u>The Essential Guide to the CyberPower CP685AVRG: How This Simple UPS Can Secure Your Devices and Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/top-8-leading-computer-manufacturers-to-watch/"><u>Top 8 Leading Computer Manufacturers to Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unveiling-gpts-personalized-guidance-feature-usage-exploration/"><u>Unveiling GPT's Personalized Guidance Feature: Usage Exploration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/1722971435571-windows-10-webcam-troubles-learn-how-to-update-the-drivers-easily/"><u>Windows 10 Webcam Troubles?

It’s a larger, wider notebook given the 15.6-inch display, but at just 2.4 pounds it is shockingly light. It’s a flyweight in a category ruled by featherweights, and while it doesn’t have quite the dense, durable-feeling form of some competitors, the lightness sure sets it apart.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike. But does LG’s laptop (2018 model reviewed) really stack up to the likes of the Apple MacBook Air and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 in terms of value and overall experience? Read on to see what we thought.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/radDS_2IRuzjTlZxUS5og2a3PIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Top_04-b051e3660efc406ab97f92df654d3762.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557743/17382" target="_top" id="1557743">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557743" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557743/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing"><a href="#Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing" class="headerlink" title="Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing"></a><strong>Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing</strong></h2><p> Weight aside, the LG Gram 15.6-inch doesn’t make the strongest impression in the category. It’s a relatively minimal design that’s not too fussed-over, but doesn’t give the impression that it was chiseled out of a solid brick of aluminum like a MacBook Air or Pro. In fact, it’s made from nano carbon magnesium, which must be how LG kept it so darn light.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Surface Laptop. It’s incredibly thin metal all around the exterior, to the extent to which a firm press on any surface just gives a little too much to feel comfortable. Likewise, the screen hinge isn’t nearly as secure as other laptops we’ve tested in this category. Our tested version didn’t come with the optional touch display, but we imagine it would be tricky to use with this much give to the display hinge.</p><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant.</p><p> In any case, that’s the trade-off for the incredible lightness, which really is amazing. The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant. This is an easy laptop to cart around or pop into a messenger bag—although it is quite wide at 14.1 inches. That’s the nature of the beast with a larger screen, but just make sure that you have a bag that can handle it.</p><p> When it comes to ports, the LG Gram 15.6-inch leaves little behind. It’s decked out. On the left side, you’ll find a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, and an HDMI port, along with the port for the included power cable—although you can also charge via USB-C. Look over on the right side and you’ll find two more USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, and even a microSD slot. Compared to those aforementioned Apple and Microsoft laptops that stick with one or two USB or USB-C ports, the LG Gram comes across as incredibly generous.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in ‘—‘ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days.</p><p> Getting our hands on the keyboard, some frustrations quickly emerged. Given the wide 15.6-inch display, LG had a lot of space to work with for the keyboard, and so it added in a full keypad to the right of the QWERTY keyboard. The problem here is twofold: some of the most-used keys, like backspace, are smaller than on many other keyboards. And to complicate matters, the keypad is scrunched right up against the keyboard without a break.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in “—“ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days. Eventually, we started learning from the harsh experience of having to essentially double-delete characters, so it’s likely that you’ll get used to the keyboard’s quirks. Typing on the keys feels great, at least: they’re soft and quiet, and enabled speedy input when not fighting those odd layout issues. On balance, it’s very usable and responsive, but still tries to cram too many keys into the available space. The trackpad, meanwhile, works fine but definitely feels a bit small on that wide body—Apple’s extra-large trackpads are spoiling us.</p><p> The entry-level model we reviewed comes with a meaty 256GB solid state drive (SSD), which is double the SSD storage we typically see in a base model laptop. While 128GB might be cutting it close for some users, the boosted tally provides plenty more space for game downloads and storing local media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1qu1WvdEgTzjUQ8QH_Lssx79xF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Trackpad_05-f0d9dc63b03e4650a92e30747090889a.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Just follow the directions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Just follow the directions</strong></h2><p> There’s little reason to worry about getting the LG Gram 15.6-inch laptop up and running quickly. It has Windows 10 pre-installed, so you’ll simply follow the onscreen prompts to enter your Wi-Fi info, check for updates, select a few options, and ultimately find yourself ready to roll on the desktop. It shouldn’t take more than a handful of minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Large-and-capable-enough"><a href="#Display-Large-and-capable-enough" class="headerlink" title="Display: Large and capable enough"></a><strong>Display: Large and capable enough</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram’s 15.6-inch screen is good, but not great. It’s certainly large: the widescreen panel stretches out longer than the 13-inch screens seen on a lot of ultraportable computers, and the extra real estate is absolutely noticeable. It gives you enough extra space to comfortably multitask, such as having a web browser and a document side-by-side, or a Slack window in full view to distract you from whatever you’re supposed to be doing for work.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike.</p><p> The downside is that this 1920x1080 IPS LCS panel isn’t nearly as high-resolution as some of its rivals, such as the MacBook Air (2560x1600) and Surface Laptop 2 (2256x1504)—both of which also benefit from squeezing their pixels into smaller respective frames. The LG Gram just doesn’t have the pin-sharp allure of those screens, plus it looks dimmer and doesn’t come across as vibrant as a result. It’s solid, and 1080p can certainly get the job done, but there are much better-looking screens in this category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TFbt9G36hk5JyrBL8cIdIuYQ66E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Keyboard_03-fd7e355ac5944f12a8107746d0afbf24.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks"><a href="#Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks"></a><strong>Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks</strong></h2><p> With an 8th-gen Intel Core i5-8250U at 1.6Ghz and 8GB RAM onboard, the 2018 LG Gram runs on the same chipset as the Surface Laptop 2 and Dell XPS 13. It provides solid power for everyday tasks, and we didn’t run into any noticeable slowdown while moving around Windows 10, surfing the web, typing up documents, and loading up apps. It’s not a powerhouse CPU, however, and creative professionals looking for a machine for photo or video editing, for example, will surely want more processing power and RAM to play with.</p><p> In benchmark testing, the Cinebench score of 1,173 was higher than the 1,017 we registered on the entry-level Surface Laptop 2 (and higher is better), and the 975 seen on the 4K screen-equipped Dell XPS. The PCMark 10 score was higher, as well, with 3,085 on the LG Gram and just 2,112 on the Surface Laptop 2.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a MacBook or Surface Laptop.</p><p> With an integrated Intel Graphics UHD 620 GPU inside, the LG Gram isn’t built for intense gaming needs. However, it does OK with modern 3D games at low-to-medium settings. As has been the case with other laptops we’ve tried, battle royale shooter smash Fortnite defaulted to settings that looked nice but led to a very choppy frame rate in action, and we ultimately had to turn off all effects and hit low settings on nearly everything to make the game run smoothly. Switching to Rocket League, the car-soccer game ran decently with mid-to-high settings, but again we trimmed down a few settings for a speedier frame rate.</p><p> As an aside, while the LG Gram often runs near-silently, there are extended periods of time in which there’s an audible hum coming from the back. It’s not the typical, very loud fan noise that pops up while gaming or heavy multitasking from some computers, but it can be a bit grating. We noticed it while charging the computer, but also while running on the battery—with no consistency on that front. It’s a mild annoyance, but it’s one we noticed whenever it emerged.</p><h2 id="Audio-It-makes-an-impression"><a href="#Audio-It-makes-an-impression" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It makes an impression"></a><strong>Audio: It makes an impression</strong></h2><p> You won’t see the speakers when the LG Gram is standing up as normal, but you’ll hear them loud and clear. The stereo speakers are tucked underneath the laptop at the left and right edges near where your wrists rest, and thanks to the slight elevation from the rubbery feet on the bottom of the laptop, they’re given enough space for the output to shine. Audio playback sounds robust and clear—not quite to the level of Apple’s current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, but very close. We were pleased with it.</p><h2 id="Network-Connects-as-expected"><a href="#Network-Connects-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Network: Connects as expected"></a><strong>Network: Connects as expected</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram had no problem connecting to a few different networks, including a home Wi-Fi network, the Google Wi-Fi network at Starbucks, and a mobile hotspot. The connection always seemed speedy and downloads ran at a steady clip. Testing it on a home Wi-Fi network during peak evening hours, we saw a download speed of about 30Mbps and an upload speed of 13Mbps. We tested the network on an iPhone XS Max immediately after and saw comparable speeds there, as well. You can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks with ease.</p><p> Interestingly, the LG Gram also has an Ethernet-to-USB-C dongle included in the box. That’ll be handy if the Wi-Fi is on the fritz, or you’re at a hotel or conference center that somehow doesn’t have Wi-Fi in the year 2019.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AhDZOG33ttJ8LfKQnzvHO7K-S8I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Closed_02-d40445064b4945729278aeae3d8ae1c0.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Seriously-amazing"><a href="#Battery-Seriously-amazing" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Seriously amazing"></a><strong>Battery: Seriously amazing</strong></h2><p> The battery is undoubtedly one of the key highlights of the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) experience. This massive 72Wh cell is estimated to provide upwards of 19 hours of uptime, according to LG—but as is usually the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , that estimate isn’t reflective of typical use cases. Even so, with max brightness, the fact that we could get about half that amount still makes for a long-lasting experience.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100 percent brightness. That means it’s built for a full-on workday, which makes it a great option for productivity. In our video rundown test, in which we constantly stream a Netflix movie at 100 percent brightness, the LG Gram 15.6-inch lasted for 9 hours, 14 minutes. With locally-stored video, you’re sure to get a whole lot more out of it.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100% brightness.</p><h2 id="Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello"><a href="#Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello" class="headerlink" title="Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)"></a><strong>Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch comes with Windows 10 Home preinstalled, and if you’ve used Windows over the years, then you should be pretty comfortable here. Windows 10 has lightly evolved the PC operating system with feature enhancements and tweaks without losing the classic, familiar DNA within, and it’s the OS of choice for computer gaming and apps of all shapes and sizes. It’s easy to use and understand, and runs well with the Intel Core i5 and an SSD onboard.</p><p> Unfortunately, this entry-level model of the LG Gram 15.6-inch isn’t able to take advantage of Windows Hello biometric security, as the camera above the display doesn’t have the needed sensors for scanning your face. We missed the near-instantaneous facial recognition of the Surface Laptop 2, and having to type in a PIN number each time we opened up the lid. Pricier models of the laptop offer a fingerprint scanner, however.</p><h2 id="Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths"><a href="#Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths"></a><strong>Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths</strong></h2><p> Originally priced at $1,249, the entry-level LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) can now be found for about $999 as of this writing. LG has rolled out newer 2019 versions that look identical and have the same core features, but upgrade to the latest generation of Intel Core processors. You should see a little bit more speed in benchmark testing, although it’s unclear whether there’s any noticeable difference during regular usage.</p><p> In any case, $999 is a more appealing value for a computer that doesn’t pack as much polish as some rivals, but wins out when it comes to elements like battery life, screen size, and minimal weight. For some users, that’s sure to be an appealing combination. Note that you can spend quite a bit on upgrades with the LG Gram 15.6-inch, including opting for versions with a faster Intel Core i7 processor, additional RAM, a fingerprint sensor, and even a touch display if desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5yzhAkphyYfWOMofqawuktHJlA0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-v.-Surface-comparison-4946178bf2e94230820d2b19d2fb7197.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975636">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975636">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975636%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975636/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own"><a href="#LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?"></a><strong>LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 are similarly equipped, in terms of having the same processor and integrated graphics chip, although they vary quite a bit from there. As noted, the LG Gram’s claim to fame comes with the resilient battery and large screen for such a lightweight computer.</p><p> The Surface Laptop 2 can’t match those specs, but it goes for a higher-end feel between the more durable-feeling design, the Alcantara material finish around the keyboard, Windows Hello camera support, and the higher-resolution touch display. All told, the Surface Laptop 2 is a more appealing device, but the LG Gram’s long-lasting capabilities make it a workhorse option for those who don’t care as much about bells and whistles.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Well-built for productivity.</strong></p><p> There are better all-around ultraportable laptops in this price range, and we had some issues with the feeling of the build, the keyboard layout, and the merely good display quality. However, if you’re in the market for an incredibly light laptop with a big screen and a battery that lasts and lasts, it’s hard to ignore the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018). You get a very capable computer for the price, and it’s a notebook that can legitimately last through a full workday even at max brightness.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Gram 15.6-inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>UPC  15Z980-U.AAS5U1 &#x2F; 719192618947</li><li>Price  $947.77</li><li>Release Date  December 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.4 x 10.7 x 2.4 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  1.6Ghz quad-core Intel Core i5 8250U</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  256GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  72 Wh</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 3x USB-3, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-effective-ways-to-watch-multiple-youtube-videos-at-one-time/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Effective Ways to Watch Multiple YouTube Videos at One Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/est-8-linux-platforms-for-video-mastery/"><u>[New] Best 8 Linux Platforms for Video Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-essential-six-digital-forums-driving-corporate-growth-and-engagement/"><u>[Updated] Essential Six Digital Forums Driving Corporate Growth & Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-sound-loads-in-inshot-editing-software/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Sound Loads in InShot Editing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/disable-screen-lock-on-google-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Disable screen lock on Google</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/exciting-news-disneyplus-plus-hulu-plus-max-bundle-offer-launching-this-summer-season/"><u>Exciting News!

It’s a larger, wider notebook given the 15.6-inch display, but at just 2.4 pounds it is shockingly light. It’s a flyweight in a category ruled by featherweights, and while it doesn’t have quite the dense, durable-feeling form of some competitors, the lightness sure sets it apart.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike. But does LG’s laptop (2018 model reviewed) really stack up to the likes of the Apple MacBook Air and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 in terms of value and overall experience? Read on to see what we thought.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/radDS_2IRuzjTlZxUS5og2a3PIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Top_04-b051e3660efc406ab97f92df654d3762.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123511/26400" target="_top" id="2123511">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123511" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123511/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing"><a href="#Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing" class="headerlink" title="Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing"></a><strong>Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing</strong></h2><p> Weight aside, the LG Gram 15.6-inch doesn’t make the strongest impression in the category. It’s a relatively minimal design that’s not too fussed-over, but doesn’t give the impression that it was chiseled out of a solid brick of aluminum like a MacBook Air or Pro. In fact, it’s made from nano carbon magnesium, which must be how LG kept it so darn light.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Surface Laptop. It’s incredibly thin metal all around the exterior, to the extent to which a firm press on any surface just gives a little too much to feel comfortable. Likewise, the screen hinge isn’t nearly as secure as other laptops we’ve tested in this category. Our tested version didn’t come with the optional touch display, but we imagine it would be tricky to use with this much give to the display hinge.</p><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant.</p><p> In any case, that’s the trade-off for the incredible lightness, which really is amazing. The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant. This is an easy laptop to cart around or pop into a messenger bag—although it is quite wide at 14.1 inches. That’s the nature of the beast with a larger screen, but just make sure that you have a bag that can handle it.</p><p> When it comes to ports, the LG Gram 15.6-inch leaves little behind. It’s decked out. On the left side, you’ll find a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, and an HDMI port, along with the port for the included power cable—although you can also charge via USB-C. Look over on the right side and you’ll find two more USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, and even a microSD slot. Compared to those aforementioned Apple and Microsoft laptops that stick with one or two USB or USB-C ports, the LG Gram comes across as incredibly generous.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in ‘—‘ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days.</p><p> Getting our hands on the keyboard, some frustrations quickly emerged. Given the wide 15.6-inch display, LG had a lot of space to work with for the keyboard, and so it added in a full keypad to the right of the QWERTY keyboard. The problem here is twofold: some of the most-used keys, like backspace, are smaller than on many other keyboards. And to complicate matters, the keypad is scrunched right up against the keyboard without a break.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in “—“ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days. Eventually, we started learning from the harsh experience of having to essentially double-delete characters, so it’s likely that you’ll get used to the keyboard’s quirks. Typing on the keys feels great, at least: they’re soft and quiet, and enabled speedy input when not fighting those odd layout issues. On balance, it’s very usable and responsive, but still tries to cram too many keys into the available space. The trackpad, meanwhile, works fine but definitely feels a bit small on that wide body—Apple’s extra-large trackpads are spoiling us.</p><p> The entry-level model we reviewed comes with a meaty 256GB solid state drive (SSD), which is double the SSD storage we typically see in a base model laptop. While 128GB might be cutting it close for some users, the boosted tally provides plenty more space for game downloads and storing local media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1qu1WvdEgTzjUQ8QH_Lssx79xF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Trackpad_05-f0d9dc63b03e4650a92e30747090889a.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105876/7443" target="_top" id="2105876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105876/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Just follow the directions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Just follow the directions</strong></h2><p> There’s little reason to worry about getting the LG Gram 15.6-inch laptop up and running quickly. It has Windows 10 pre-installed, so you’ll simply follow the onscreen prompts to enter your Wi-Fi info, check for updates, select a few options, and ultimately find yourself ready to roll on the desktop. It shouldn’t take more than a handful of minutes.</p><h2 id="Display-Large-and-capable-enough"><a href="#Display-Large-and-capable-enough" class="headerlink" title="Display: Large and capable enough"></a><strong>Display: Large and capable enough</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram’s 15.6-inch screen is good, but not great. It’s certainly large: the widescreen panel stretches out longer than the 13-inch screens seen on a lot of ultraportable computers, and the extra real estate is absolutely noticeable. It gives you enough extra space to comfortably multitask, such as having a web browser and a document side-by-side, or a Slack window in full view to distract you from whatever you’re supposed to be doing for work.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike.</p><p> The downside is that this 1920x1080 IPS LCS panel isn’t nearly as high-resolution as some of its rivals, such as the MacBook Air (2560x1600) and Surface Laptop 2 (2256x1504)—both of which also benefit from squeezing their pixels into smaller respective frames. The LG Gram just doesn’t have the pin-sharp allure of those screens, plus it looks dimmer and doesn’t come across as vibrant as a result. It’s solid, and 1080p can certainly get the job done, but there are much better-looking screens in this category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TFbt9G36hk5JyrBL8cIdIuYQ66E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Keyboard_03-fd7e355ac5944f12a8107746d0afbf24.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948932/19272" target="_top" id="1948932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks"><a href="#Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks"></a><strong>Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks</strong></h2><p> With an 8th-gen Intel Core i5-8250U at 1.6Ghz and 8GB RAM onboard, the 2018 LG Gram runs on the same chipset as the Surface Laptop 2 and Dell XPS 13. It provides solid power for everyday tasks, and we didn’t run into any noticeable slowdown while moving around Windows 10, surfing the web, typing up documents, and loading up apps. It’s not a powerhouse CPU, however, and creative professionals looking for a machine for photo or video editing, for example, will surely want more processing power and RAM to play with.</p><p> In benchmark testing, the Cinebench score of 1,173 was higher than the 1,017 we registered on the entry-level Surface Laptop 2 (and higher is better), and the 975 seen on the 4K screen-equipped Dell XPS. The PCMark 10 score was higher, as well, with 3,085 on the LG Gram and just 2,112 on the Surface Laptop 2.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a MacBook or Surface Laptop.</p><p> With an integrated Intel Graphics UHD 620 GPU inside, the LG Gram isn’t built for intense gaming needs. However, it does OK with modern 3D games at low-to-medium settings. As has been the case with other laptops we’ve tried, battle royale shooter smash Fortnite defaulted to settings that looked nice but led to a very choppy frame rate in action, and we ultimately had to turn off all effects and hit low settings on nearly everything to make the game run smoothly. Switching to Rocket League, the car-soccer game ran decently with mid-to-high settings, but again we trimmed down a few settings for a speedier frame rate.</p><p> As an aside, while the LG Gram often runs near-silently, there are extended periods of time in which there’s an audible hum coming from the back. It’s not the typical, very loud fan noise that pops up while gaming or heavy multitasking from some computers, but it can be a bit grating. We noticed it while charging the computer, but also while running on the battery—with no consistency on that front. It’s a mild annoyance, but it’s one we noticed whenever it emerged.</p><h2 id="Audio-It-makes-an-impression"><a href="#Audio-It-makes-an-impression" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It makes an impression"></a><strong>Audio: It makes an impression</strong></h2><p> You won’t see the speakers when the LG Gram is standing up as normal, but you’ll hear them loud and clear. The stereo speakers are tucked underneath the laptop at the left and right edges near where your wrists rest, and thanks to the slight elevation from the rubbery feet on the bottom of the laptop, they’re given enough space for the output to shine. Audio playback sounds robust and clear—not quite to the level of Apple’s current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, but very close. We were pleased with it.</p><h2 id="Network-Connects-as-expected"><a href="#Network-Connects-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Network: Connects as expected"></a><strong>Network: Connects as expected</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram had no problem connecting to a few different networks, including a home Wi-Fi network, the Google Wi-Fi network at Starbucks, and a mobile hotspot. The connection always seemed speedy and downloads ran at a steady clip. Testing it on a home Wi-Fi network during peak evening hours, we saw a download speed of about 30Mbps and an upload speed of 13Mbps. We tested the network on an iPhone XS Max immediately after and saw comparable speeds there, as well. You can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks with ease.</p><p> Interestingly, the LG Gram also has an Ethernet-to-USB-C dongle included in the box. That’ll be handy if the Wi-Fi is on the fritz, or you’re at a hotel or conference center that somehow doesn’t have Wi-Fi in the year 2019.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AhDZOG33ttJ8LfKQnzvHO7K-S8I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Closed_02-d40445064b4945729278aeae3d8ae1c0.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Seriously-amazing"><a href="#Battery-Seriously-amazing" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Seriously amazing"></a><strong>Battery: Seriously amazing</strong></h2><p> The battery is undoubtedly one of the key highlights of the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) experience. This massive 72Wh cell is estimated to provide upwards of 19 hours of uptime, according to LG—but as is usually the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , that estimate isn’t reflective of typical use cases. Even so, with max brightness, the fact that we could get about half that amount still makes for a long-lasting experience.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100 percent brightness. That means it’s built for a full-on workday, which makes it a great option for productivity. In our video rundown test, in which we constantly stream a Netflix movie at 100 percent brightness, the LG Gram 15.6-inch lasted for 9 hours, 14 minutes. With locally-stored video, you’re sure to get a whole lot more out of it.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100% brightness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello"><a href="#Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello" class="headerlink" title="Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)"></a><strong>Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch comes with Windows 10 Home preinstalled, and if you’ve used Windows over the years, then you should be pretty comfortable here. Windows 10 has lightly evolved the PC operating system with feature enhancements and tweaks without losing the classic, familiar DNA within, and it’s the OS of choice for computer gaming and apps of all shapes and sizes. It’s easy to use and understand, and runs well with the Intel Core i5 and an SSD onboard.</p><p> Unfortunately, this entry-level model of the LG Gram 15.6-inch isn’t able to take advantage of Windows Hello biometric security, as the camera above the display doesn’t have the needed sensors for scanning your face. We missed the near-instantaneous facial recognition of the Surface Laptop 2, and having to type in a PIN number each time we opened up the lid. Pricier models of the laptop offer a fingerprint scanner, however.</p><h2 id="Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths"><a href="#Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths"></a><strong>Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths</strong></h2><p> Originally priced at $1,249, the entry-level LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) can now be found for about $999 as of this writing. LG has rolled out newer 2019 versions that look identical and have the same core features, but upgrade to the latest generation of Intel Core processors. You should see a little bit more speed in benchmark testing, although it’s unclear whether there’s any noticeable difference during regular usage.</p><p> In any case, $999 is a more appealing value for a computer that doesn’t pack as much polish as some rivals, but wins out when it comes to elements like battery life, screen size, and minimal weight. For some users, that’s sure to be an appealing combination. Note that you can spend quite a bit on upgrades with the LG Gram 15.6-inch, including opting for versions with a faster Intel Core i7 processor, additional RAM, a fingerprint sensor, and even a touch display if desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5yzhAkphyYfWOMofqawuktHJlA0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-v.-Surface-comparison-4946178bf2e94230820d2b19d2fb7197.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own"><a href="#LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?"></a><strong>LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 are similarly equipped, in terms of having the same processor and integrated graphics chip, although they vary quite a bit from there. As noted, the LG Gram’s claim to fame comes with the resilient battery and large screen for such a lightweight computer.</p><p> The Surface Laptop 2 can’t match those specs, but it goes for a higher-end feel between the more durable-feeling design, the Alcantara material finish around the keyboard, Windows Hello camera support, and the higher-resolution touch display. All told, the Surface Laptop 2 is a more appealing device, but the LG Gram’s long-lasting capabilities make it a workhorse option for those who don’t care as much about bells and whistles.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Well-built for productivity.</strong></p><p> There are better all-around ultraportable laptops in this price range, and we had some issues with the feeling of the build, the keyboard layout, and the merely good display quality. However, if you’re in the market for an incredibly light laptop with a big screen and a battery that lasts and lasts, it’s hard to ignore the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018). You get a very capable computer for the price, and it’s a notebook that can legitimately last through a full workday even at max brightness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Gram 15.6-inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>UPC  15Z980-U.AAS5U1 &#x2F; 719192618947</li><li>Price  $947.77</li><li>Release Date  December 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.4 x 10.7 x 2.4 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  1.6Ghz quad-core Intel Core i5 8250U</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  256GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  72 Wh</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 3x USB-3, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-effortless-media-incorporation-youtube-to-slides/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Effortless Media Incorporation YouTube to Slides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-strategizing-with-snapshots-a-guide-to-instagram-video-marketing/"><u>[New] Strategizing with Snapshots A Guide to Instagram Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-selection-top-video-editors-for-webcams-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Selection Top Video Editors for Webcams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/can-you-submerge-your-iphone-13-without-damage/"><u>Can You Submerge Your iPhone 13 Without Damage?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-maximizing-your-network-with-the-netgear-ex3700-wi-fi-extender-ac750/"><u>Expert Analysis: Maximizing Your Network with the Netgear EX3700 Wi-Fi Extender (AC750)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-insight-on-why-the-new-apple-ipad-air-2019-is-a-game-changer-in-digital-entertainment/"><u>Expert Insight on Why the New Apple iPad Air (2019) Is a Game-Changer in Digital Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/get-your-samsung-m2020-printer-drivers-instantly-free-download/"><u>Get Your Samsung M2020 Printer Drivers Instantly, Free Download!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-simulate-gps-movement-in-ar-games-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12r-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/syma-s111g-rc-helicopter-review-the-ultimate-low-cost-choice-for-home-flight-fun/"><u>Syma S111G R/C Helicopter Review: The Ultimate Low-Cost Choice for Home Flight Fun</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-ideal-beginners-choice-nokia-31-smartphone-evaluation/"><u>The Ideal Beginner's Choice: Nokia 3.1 Smartphone Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamline-your-mixes-a-curated-list-of-the-top-5-dynamic-audio-ducking-tools-for-producers/"><u>Updated In 2024, Streamline Your Mixes A Curated List of the Top 5 Dynamic Audio Ducking Tools for Producers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049364/7443" target="_top" id="2049364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049364/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148649/16836" target="_top" id="2148649">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148649" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148649/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135370/19272" target="_top" id="2135370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135370/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re interested in moving more and monitoring daily activities with the help of a chic fitness-tracking watch, the Garmin Vivomove HR is worth a closer look. The is an accessory aimed at those who like to be active and stylish too. I wore and used this watch for over a week and was impressed with the look of it, level of wellness data captured, and the overall support it offers for general well-being.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/I4tLxDp9_npPph8lgb8sOWODnd4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-3-c8e32586b7d840a0a2c9747a6255b802.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a polished regular watch"></a><strong>Design: Looks like a polished regular watch</strong></h2><p> Some people enjoy the sporty design of an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-models-4175232" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Samsung smartwatch. But if you feel like you’re compromising utility over personal style with those options, the Garmin Vivomove HR offers a happy middle ground.</p><p> The watch I tested was fitted with a brown leather band and gold stainless steel case. If you were to glance at it, you wouldn’t be able to tell that there’s a lot going on underneath the surface. With a simple turn of the wrist the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , placed discreetly in the bottom center of the watch face, illuminates for at-a-glance access to step count and other data. The watch hands also conveniently move out of the way for better visibility and return to reflect the current time when not in use.</p><p> The overall size of the Vivomove HR is 43 x 43 x 11.6 millimeters (HWD) and the display measures 0.38 x 0.76 inches. On larger wrists, this won’t be a big deal, but smaller wrists like mine could face a fit challenge since the face is on the larger side. But the device as a whole only weighs 56.5 grams, which won’t weigh you down. It also comes with a 5 ATM water-resistance rating, which means you’re good to use this for lap swimming and other water sports, and won’t need to worry about rain and snow exposure. I wore this watch in the shower and when washing dishes and found it to be effective against repelling water and always dried quickly.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection. The clip opens easily and must be placed directly onto the charging contacts on the back of the watch face in order to charge&#x2F;transfer data. This charging method is a bit of a quirk of some Garmin watches, but it eliminates the need for charging ports that could be at risk when exposed to moisture.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect"><a href="#Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect"></a><strong>Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Garmin Vivomove HR is easy through the Garmin Connect app. I already had the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> downloaded on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pick-best-iphone-for-you-1999293" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which made the fast setup process speedier. The app immediately detected the Vivomove HR and then presented on-screen instructions for calibrating the watch hands, setting the wrist placement (right or left), widget preferences, and touring basic functions. This took a matter of minutes since the Garmin Vivomove HR was nearly fully charged out of the box.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky"><a href="#Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky"></a><strong>Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky</strong></h2><p> I wore the Garmin Vivomove HR during waking and sleeping hours and never experienced discomfort while I slept. If I did experience any issues, it was during the day when conducting routine tasks—especially typing. Invariably the watch would shift and the larger face made contact with my wristbone.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more.</p><p> During sleeping hours, though, I wasn’t disturbed by any shifting of the timepiece. And since sleep mode is on by default, I wasn’t bothered by notifications or the screen illuminating. When trying to fall asleep or during waking moments, I was occasionally startled by the green light from the heart-rate sensor on the back of the watch face. If you get a tight fit against your wrist, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p><p> In terms of overall ease of use, the only actions you’ll need to master are touching and swiping the screen: there are no buttons or bezels to deal with. Touch prompts sound like a no-brainer and an appealing way to interact with the watch, but I found the screen to be fussy and slow to respond at times. If I didn’t tap the screen in just the right way, I had to repeatedly tap until I could stop or start a workout timer. And if I failed to complete a full sweeping motion through the widgets, the screen wouldn’t advance to the next item. Instead I ended up just drilling down further into that particular category.</p><p> For example, if I didn’t fully swipe past the weather widget information for the day, the screen would take me to the weekly forecast. Then I had to press the back button to get to the general widgets screen. With continued use, I became savvier with touch and swiping actions, but it was still a consistent issue when trying to start&#x2F;stop workout timers. This was an even bigger issue outside and in bright sunlight, which made the screen virtually undetectable.</p><h2 id="Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training"><a href="#Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training"></a><strong>Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training</strong></h2><p> The Vivomove HR is a well-rounded device. Not only does it look fashionable as an everyday accessory, but it also offers stopwatch functions, monitors heart rate (resting and active), automatically tracks activities such as running, walking, and even using an elliptical machine, and tracks steps, calories, and other fitness data such as VO2 max.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more. The Move Bar, while annoying, ultimately encouraged me to avoid prolonged periods of sitting or standing by simply reminding me to move if I hadn’t been very active in the last hour. But when it comes to accuracy as a fitness tracker, I wasn’t wildly impressed.</p><p> On a few short 1 to 3-mile runs, the Vivomove HR recorded my speed as up to 1 minute faster than my Garmin Forerunner 35 running watch. Heart rate was also considerably more elevated according to the Vivomove. And when I launched a strength training activity, the counter was always behind by about five reps. The Move IQ technology that auto-detects workouts didn’t always get it right either. Frequently when I was walking, the watch logged that stretch of movement as a running or an elliptical machine session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VpHve66CRb4yVumQ8GVo-3vNLGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-2-240036104f704a2d8c8f8425f075709b.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options"><a href="#Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options" class="headerlink" title="Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options"></a><strong>Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options</strong></h2><p> Fortunately, saving workout information and viewing any activity from the watch is easy and foolproof through the Garmin Connect app. If you prefer to set this watch up and sync data using your computer, the Garmin Express software allows you to complete the same steps for setting up and configuring the device along with syncing data with your Garmin Connect account and checking for software updates.</p><p> It’s entirely possible to choose between either setup, despite the quick-start instructions that indicate everything should be done through the mobile app. But using the app alone and syncing regularly helps send automatic software updates directly to the device when not in use. At any point you can log in to the Garmin Connect web app, regardless of which way you decide to sync data, to view your information on a larger display and download it.</p><p> The key features of the software revolve around basic activity tracking from climbing flights of stairs to monitoring all-day stress levels (based on heart rate) to breaking down hours of deep versus light sleep. While this is information you can glance at on your watch, the app distills all of this general wellness into daily, weekly, and monthly reports.</p><p> There’s also plenty of customization power when it comes to organizing the activity tracking data you see on your watch display and in the app itself. You can choose the widgets displayed such as music controls to control music on your smartphone and the number of intensity workout minutes you’ve reached for the week. And if you prefer to shuffle the way that data is arranged in the mobile app, there’s a simple drag and drop feature that helps you do that.</p><p> This complementary software also places the control in your hands when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-social-media-explaining-the-big-trend-3486616" >social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sharing and integrating with outside fitness-tracking platforms such as Map My Run and Strava—which you can easily do from the Garmin Connect mobile and web apps.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days"><a href="#Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid performance for five days"></a><strong>Battery: Solid performance for five days</strong></h2><p> Garmin says that this watch can last for over two weeks in watch mode and up to five days in smartwatch mode—which I can confirm. This claim tracked even with frequent glancing at the display and toggling through the widgets as well as receiving regular text and email updates throughout the day. I didn’t see the battery drain in any consistent way until the fifth day. And recharging the watch was fast: it took about only one hour.</p><h2 id="Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen"><a href="#Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen"></a><strong>Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR ranges in price from around $200 for the Sport version that comes with a silicone band to $350 for Premium leather-band alternatives. There are certainly cheaper hybrid smartwatch options on the market. Both the Withings Move Steel HR and Fossil Smartwatch HR Collider retail for less than $200. And while they offer similar features such as message previews, heart rate, weather and sleep data, and even GPS, neither offers a touchscreen display and unique health data like stress level readings based on heart rate patterns.</p><h2 id="Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR"><a href="#Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR"></a><strong>Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move Steel HR ($180 MSRP) also occupies a similar space. It matches the Vivomove HR by offering optical wrist-based heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, water-resistance up to 50 meters, and smartphone notifications. The Withings Move Steel HR also has a stylish analog watch look, but if you prefer a flat over curved face and a touchscreen you can interact with, the Vivomove HR takes the prize. Heart-rate tracking inconsistencies plague both watches, but the Withings does come with connected GPS compatibility.</p><p> While this is a boon for distance tracking during workouts, the downside is that you’ll need to have your smartphone with you. The Withings Move Steel HR battery longevity is supposed to be 25 days and an additional month without smart mode turned off. But if you prefer the touchscreen interaction rather than the dual displays—one dial that monitors step count progress by percentage and one LCD that displays notifications—the Vivomove could be worth the extra money.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality hybrid watch that’s best for general wellness tracking and basic smart features.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR isn’t the watch to reach for when you want to accurately log running or cycling workouts, but if you want a larger bird’s-eye view of your wellness, this is worth considering. It’s stylish enough for work and everyday wear and possesses thoughtful design details and health tracking features other hybrid smartwatch competitors don’t.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none;

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you have a growing family or a growing list of devices competing for bandwidth in your home, you’ve probably experienced jockeying for a signal here or there. That’s where a capable tri-band router like the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router comes in handy. This router boasts high-speed Wi-Fi of up to 3.2Gbps and three different Wi-Fi bands that work simultaneously to deliver the connectivity all your family members and devices require.</p><p> We used this tri-band router and observed various aspects starting with the setup process, software ease of use, and performance power when performing typical streaming and browsing activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q6eQHVPL_nzfI20_HhRY5seg85c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-3-3baf530c5df54c9c903579053d19c25c.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-A-little-flashy"><a href="#Design-A-little-flashy" class="headerlink" title="Design: A little flashy"></a><strong>Design: A little flashy</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 router is aptly named for its six antennas that are fixed to both sides of the face of the device. While you can easily fold these antennas flat, for easy moving to and from one spot to another, you’ll need to place them upright in order to maximize the signal strength.</p><p> Aside from the unique antenna design, all the indicator lights are also presented in a sort of stylish way right down the middle of the router. All the lights flash white and the Wi-Fi on&#x2F;off and WPS buttons are set off on their own at the bottom with triangular buttons. The main body of the router is box-like in shape and skews larger with dimensions of 11.63 x 8.92 x 2.14 inches (HWD). Some shoppers may like the aeronautic design of the router, inspired by the Nighthawk stealth fighter plane, which also looks somewhat futuristic. If you’re looking for a router that’s unassuming, you won’t find that here.</p><p> All the ports are easy to locate at the back of the device. These include four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one WAN port, and one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and one USB 2.0 port. You’ll also find the power button and DC power input in the same row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GsN851fjmzxtWs6ShQfaWQtEPok=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-2-b6366698f8d14745a5027973d8657745.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-with-a-few-bumps-in-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple, with a few bumps in the road</strong></h2><p> Unboxing the Nighthawk X6 R8000, we were reminded several times to download the companion Nighthawk<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete the setup process. There is a sticker on top of the router with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the app can use to detect the router and launches a quick setup process, but we couldn’t get this code to register. Instead, we went to the App Store and manually downloaded the mobile app.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices.</p><p> The first thing we had to do when we launched the Nighthawk app was to create a Netgear account. Then we chose the “New Setup” option and were directed to reboot our modem and then attach the provided Ethernet cable into the router and our modem. Almost instantly we were able to connect to the default network using the credentials the manufacturer provided. We returned to the app to set up another line of defense to the router admin login credentials with security questions and customize our system network and password.</p><p> After these changes, we had to reconnect to the network which went off without a hitch. We further chose to apply the firmware update that was recommended. That took several minutes and also required rebooting the router. At this point, we noticed that the second 5GHz connection was lost. After several attempts to make things right by resetting the router and the modem and router, the only step that resolved it was a factory reset. We suspect this could have been an issue with the firmware update, but once all of that was finally resolved we were able to connect to our 150Mbps Xfinity service on all three bands.</p><p> Overall, minus the hitch that tacked on an additional 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, we found the guided setup to be straightforward, quick, and easy to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHfwPJF-cpnSAITo_i4moZ2Jnw0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-4-1d3586d798cf44a9b219c9fd885069b3.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology"><a href="#Connectivity-Focused-on-the-most-innovative-technology" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology"></a><strong>Connectivity: Focused on the most innovative technology</strong></h2><p> This is an 802.11ac tri-band router, meaning it supports three frequencies: one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz channels on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/802-11ac-in-wireless-networking-818284" >802.11ac wireless standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The advantage here is that unlike older single- or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that operate on older Wi-Fi standards or even newer dual-band options functioning on the most current Wi-Fi 5 standard, there’s additional support for more devices and less competition over bandwidth.</p><p> That’s supported by beamforming technology, which is a feature all 802.11ac routers support. This technology sends targeted Wi-Fi signals to your devices rather than sending them in every direction. Ultimately, this means a stronger direct signal to your laptop, TV, or other devices, and potentially more consistent and stronger connections.</p><p> Since this router is classified as an AC3200 device, that means it has the potential to deliver up to 600Mbps (megabit per second) on the 2.4GHz spectrum and up to 1300Mbps on the 5GHz channels. This Wi-Fi speed rating doesn’t guarantee you’ll see these exact results in your home. It’s merely a number that describes the absolute potential performance power. In reality, the speeds you see will depend on the type of internet service plan you have and other environmental and network conditions that impact wireless performance.</p><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 also comes with Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) technology, which is another tool for managing bandwidth by allocating signals in specific directions and based on your priorities. Netgear says that users who like to game and stream video (and have combined download and upload speeds of less than 300Mbps) could garner enhanced performance by enabling this feature, which you can do from the web interface—but not the app.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming</strong></h2><p> Using the Nighthawk app’s built-in speed test feature, which uses the Ookla SpeedTest technology, the best download speed registered at 95Mbps right after we set up the router. More typically, the output was around 88-95Mbps at varying points in the day.</p><p> We could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands.</p><p> We never experienced a completely dropped connection, but at times the 2.4GHz channel performed sluggishly with simple operations like checking email or online browsing. We connected TVs where we stream HD and 4K content and use a gaming console to the 5GHz networks and used the 2.4GHz channel for laptops, mobile devices, and a tablet. Distributing those devices across the other two bands seemed to ease some congestion, and we could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands. We also noticed a mild improvement in image clarity and loading speed of streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.</p><p> Though we were unable to test the full range of this router, we had no issues in our 1,100-square-foot space. The manufacturer does say that this device can serve very large homes and there are six antennas that help boost this coverage, but the actual range—just like speed—will depend on factors like the thickness of your walls, router placement, and interference from other signals and devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qDgf4s6CZg8XEea_CVo6DMwg5lg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-5-733eda7f890a4105b5bc94ddf8169c81.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly and intuitive"></a><strong>Software: User-friendly and intuitive</strong></h2><p> Everything is laid out quite cleanly in the Nighthawk app in terms of guided setup and accessing the information most users will probably be interested in—like speed information, devices connected, Wi-Fi settings, and parental controls using the Circle with Disney app to monitor everyone’s screen time and activity. The app also comes with a 30-day trial of Netgear Armor security, which does the work of detecting threats from malware, bots, and any other network vulnerabilities.</p><p> The mobile app certainly skews more toward the general user with its uncomplicated layout, but that also means less control over more technical specifications which requires using the web interface. This information isn’t necessarily hidden, but it’s only laid out in the user manual which is accessible from the Netgear site.</p><p> This router is equally friendly to the general user as well as the more tech-savvy customer.</p><p> While the Nighthawk X6 does come with built-in firewall protection, you can elevate security settings and personalize the router setup from the router’s web interface. From the web GUI’s advanced settings area, you can control access or block certain websites, set up security email notifications, establish VPN service, create a personal FTP server, or use<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-dynamic-dns-816294" >Dynamic DNS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Other features of interest through the web GUI include setting up a USB device to perform Time Machine backups for Mac laptops and using the router’s media server capabilities to play music from the iTunes server.</p><p> In this respect, the Nighthawk X6 R8000 is equally friendly to the general user who doesn’t want to delve into the technical deep end as well as the more tech-savvy customer who does.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-bit-steep"><a href="#Price-A-bit-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bit steep"></a><strong>Price: A bit steep</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 has a list price of $270, which certainly places it in the high-end tier of wireless routers. And while it’s not the most expensive tri-band router on the market, your decision to make this investment could come down to factors like how large your home is, how many devices you’re working with, and how fast your internet service plan is. The tri-band Wi-Fi technology is impressive, and there are many attractive features: an intuitive and low-effort app, built-in security with Netgear Armor, as well as a detailed level of control over managing how everyone in the family spends their screen time, but there are equally capable as less expensive options on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200</strong></h2><p> One of the strengths of the Nighthawk X6 R800 is how fast and simple it is to set up for even those who are tech-shy. But if you’re willing or interested in diving in deeper technically, paying less, and still obtaining impressive Wi-Fi performance, the Asus RT-AC3200 retails for $200 and overlaps with the Nighthawk X6 in a number of ways. Both feature three bands, six antennas, QoS and beamforming technologies, VPN and Time Machine support, and peace of mind with respective built-in security platforms.</p><p> The Asus router does require a little more technical know-how for managing the router via the app and web interface. Another factor that may influence whether you think this trade-off is worth it is your interest in integrating your router into a smart-home configuration. The Nighthawk X6 R8000, like many other<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-netgear-routers-4159862" >Netgear routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does allow that with Amazon Alexa compatibility whereas the Asus RT-AC3200 does not.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An investment that could be worth it for the family with a smart home.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices. If you’re interested in spending less time with configuration and more time benefiting from the assurance that your network is protected, the Nighthawk X6 can fulfill those wants. You can also easily bring this device into the fold of your smart-home setup and keep a close eye on the online safety and activity of everyone in the family.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router (R8000)</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>MPN  R8000</li><li>Price  $269.99</li><li>Weight  2.43 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.63 x 8 x 2.14 in.</li><li>Compatibility  Amazon Echo&#x2F;Alexa</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antenna  6</li><li>Number of Bands  3</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  7</li><li>Chipset  BCM4709AO</li><li>Range  Very large homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-online-presence-with-obs-facebook-linking/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Online Presence with OBS-Facebook Linking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-image-innovation-at-your-fingertips-applications-for-photo-text-adjustments-for-2024/"><u>[New] Image Innovation at Your Fingertips Applications for Photo Text Adjustments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-tiktok-sound-as-your-phones-ringtone/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide to TikTok Sound as Your Phone's Ringtone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-leading-techniques-for-effective-webp-to-jpeg-change/"><u>[Updated] Leading Techniques for Effective WebP to JPEG Change</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-smooth-loop-setup-tailoring-youtube-content-for-television/"><u>[Updated] Smooth Loop Setup Tailoring YouTube Content for Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-synchronizing-with-instagram-perfect-video-integration/"><u>2024 Approved Synchronizing With Instagram Perfect Video Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-latest-microsoft-bluetooth-driver-for-windows-101187-download-and-update-options/"><u>How to Get the Latest Microsoft Bluetooth Driver for Windows 10/11/8/7 -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black is the result of multiple refinements since the original model, and through its many iterations, it’s become one of the most popular and high-tech action cameras on the market. From insanely advanced image stabilization to live streaming capabilities, the HERO7 Black is built for more than just action shots.</p><p> We recently got our hands on this tiny powerhouse to see if the improvements in software and video quality are worth its asking price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Design-Classic-action-camera-design"><a href="#Design-Classic-action-camera-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classic action camera design"></a><strong>Design: Classic action camera design</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black measures in at 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 inches, so it’s super compact and almost a cube. The device is all black with a very nice rubber casing around the unit that makes it feel soft to the touch.</p><p> The design is very minimal. The power button is located on the right side of the camera and a record button at the top. On the side, there is a door that hides the USB and HDMI ports, and another door on the bottom that conceals the battery and MicroSD port. The front of the camera has a small screen that displays the current settings.</p><p> All these doors protect the camera’s ports from the elements and give it a tough outer shell that’s rugged enough to survive rough falls and submersion in up to 33 feet of water. The HERO7 Black is a great travel camera that can be taken on exotic trips where water adventures and rough terrain are a part of your itinerary.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black we noticed that the body of the device becomes very hot when used for long periods of time. We tested it for a few hours nonstop and noticed it was still very warm even when it was not recording. This can be a big concern if the device is used for long recordings in hot temperatures.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-visible"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-visible" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and visible"></a><strong>Display: Bright and visible</strong></h2><p> The back of the GoPro HERO7 Black has a two-inch touchscreen that is bright and easy to read. While testing the camera, we were able to navigate through the menus with the single touch of a finger, which are intuitive and easy to adjust. Simply tap to select.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup: Updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black did not have much battery life out of the box. Once we powered it on, we set the date, time, and location. It then prompted us to update the software, which required a blank memory card and fully-charged battery to complete.</p><p> The HERO7 Black has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easy to pair with a smartphone that has the GoPro App downloaded. We were able to make the camera discoverable in the Preferences menu, and then the app could automatically scan and connect to the camera when it was opened.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sensor-Small-but-mighty"><a href="#Sensor-Small-but-mighty" class="headerlink" title="Sensor: Small but mighty"></a><strong>Sensor: Small but mighty</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black boasts a 1&#x2F;2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor that is built for action. The new and improved image processor now has the ability to stabilize footage through electronic image stabilization technology called HyperSmooth. This feature works by tracking unwanted motion in your videos and algorithmically correcting shake. It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><p> We took the GoPro out and recorded some handheld video as we walked around, which would normally have some shake to it. The footage from the HERO7 Black was smooth and it did not contain any camera shake, almost as if we’d been using a gimbal.</p><p> It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><h2 id="Lens-Great-for-video"><a href="#Lens-Great-for-video" class="headerlink" title="Lens: Great for video"></a><strong>Lens: Great for video</strong></h2><p> The fixed lens on the GoPro HERO7 Black shoots wide or in SuperView mode, the latter of which is an extra-wide field of view and can sometimes give a kind of distorted fisheye effect to your footage. This distortion can be frustrating, but there are ways to work around it during editing, including using video editing software to correct. And when shooting at a lower resolution, the camera can shoot with a linear field of view which reduces the distortion of the lens. The SuperView is not available when shooting in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates"><a href="#Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates"></a><strong>Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quality of the GoPro HERO7 Black is gorgeous. Content creators and travel vloggers will absolutely appreciate this camera’s recording capabilities.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black, the 4K video looked its best when recording in bright lighting conditions. In lower light, the quality began to degrade and grain started to form in the shadow areas of the scene.</p><p> New to the GoPro HERO7 is the ability to create a TimeWarp video. This feature allows the user to create super smooth time-lapse videos with HyperSmooth technology, so the camera doesn’t have to be stationary. This opens up the ability to be more creative when making time lapse videos.</p><p> The ability to capture 1080p video at 240fps is also a game-changer. The slow-motion feature of this camera is stunning, producing beautiful smooth footage, especially when used in bright lighting conditions. If you’re an athlete looking to record and analyze footage of yourself, the HERO7 Black gives you a great way to slow down footage and study movement.</p><p> The GoPro HERO7 also has a live stream feature. Using the GoPro app, you can set up a live video feed by connecting to your Facebook, YouTube, and various other social media networks. Once connected to the desired account, you will be able to go live within minutes.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about</strong></h2><p> The photo quality on the GoPro HERO7 Black is average, though it does have the ability to create HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.</p><p> Due to the lens distortion, the images that this camera produces have a specific look that you may either love or hate. It also has a fixed lens that does not zoom, so that limits its functionality compared to typical point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> But generally speaking, the GoPro HERO7 Black is not a camera known for its stunning photographs—it is known for its stunning video capabilities. It’s not for someone that wants to use it specifically for still photographs.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black’s microphones are sensitive and record ambient noise easily. The microphones are located on the body of the camera and any slight touch becomes audible in your video. When taking some handheld footage, we accidentally covered up the microphones with our fingers, which caused the audio to sound muffled in our video.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera.</p><p> The internal microphones are useful if the sound is not a priority in your videos, but if great audio is a necessity, it is best to invest in an external microphone. You can connect one to the HERO7 Black through the USB connection, which opens up possibilities for external microphones, lapel mics, and digital audio recorders to enhance sound recording capabilities.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera. Pairing the 4K resolution with great audio quality, this camera becomes a powerful tool in the hands of the right content creator.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing"><a href="#Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing</strong></h2><p> Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze with the GoPro HERO7 Black. Once we installed the GoPro app on our smartphone, the camera connected instantly. The app also gave us a much larger and easier-to-read interface, plus a live view function that allowed us to use our phone to frame and compose videos and remotely control the camera.</p><p> Inside the app, there are also options to edit mode settings, change the original set up, review camera info, changed Wi-Fi remotes, as well as monitor the battery level and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-format-sd-card-camera-4587017" >SD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capacity.

For those who are considering the GoPro as a vlogging camera, the PowerShot is another great option. It records video at 1080p rather than 4K, but it has a larger 20.3-megapixel sensor and a 180-degree articulating LCD touchscreen display that’s perfect for self-recording.</p><p> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II utilizes an advanced DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which creates better photographs than the GoPro HERO7 Black. This image processor also provides better video stabilization and autofocusing for video, though it’s admittedly not as advanced as the GoPro’s HyperSmooth feature.</p><p> Comparing this to the GoPro HERO7 Black, the Canon is much more user-friendly. It’s a better fit for those that want a versatile camera that they can grab and use easily, without having to maneuver through menus on a tiny screen.</p><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot SX740 HS:</em></strong> Retailing for $400, the Canon PowerShot SX740 HS is right on par price-wise with the GoPro HERO7 Black. The PowerShot is also capable of recording 4K video, but it lacks the frame rates that the GoPro HERO7 Black is capable of. It’s also capable of capturing photos without distortion, which makes it a more versatile camera.</p><p> The PowerShot SX740 HS is geared toward someone that wants a little bit of everything. It can shoot 4K and take photographs, but it doesn’t quite live up to the excellent video quality of the GoPro. The PowerShot is also a more user-friendly device that is suited for people familiar with standard point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> The camera also has a 180-degree adjustable LCD screen, which makes it an even more powerful tool for vloggers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-review-4705542" >Canon PowerShot SX740 HS Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A rugged and compact action camera with fantastic video stabilization.</strong></p><p> Between the amazing video quality and the enhanced HyperSmooth electronic image stabilization, the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers who want to record or even live-stream their most rugged expeditions. It produces beautiful videos with enhanced color and sharpness and is small enough to wear or mount somewhere without it getting in the way.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/akaso-ek7000-pro-4k-action-camera-review-4770265" >AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-review-4706895" >Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-dsc-w800-review-4589510" >Sony DSC-W800 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  HERO7 Black</li><li>Product Brand  GoPro</li><li>MPN  CHDHX-701</li><li>Price  $399.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 in.</li><li>Sensor  12MP, 1-Chip CMOS</li><li>Video  Up to 4K at 60 fps, or 1080p at 240 fps</li><li>Audio Format  WAV</li><li>Photo ISO Range  100 - 3200 (Auto)</li><li>Burst Photos  30 photos&#x2F;sec</li><li>Output  1 x micro-HDMI (Type D)</li><li>Video ISO Range  100 - 6400 (Auto)</li><li>Input  1 x USB 3.0</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-path-to-igtv-popularity-top-strategies-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Path to IGTV Popularity Top Strategies Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/explore-interactive-features-of-the-arlo-smart-surveillance-solution/"><u>Explore Interactive Features of the Arlo Smart Surveillance Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/facebook-verification-how-to-verify-facebook-page-easily/"><u>Facebook Verification How to Verify Facebook Page Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-motorola-moto-e13-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Motorola Moto E13 Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-itel-p55-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Itel P55 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/insider-review-the-ultimate-guide-to-galaxys-ford-f-150-rc-trucks/"><u>Insider Review: The Ultimate Guide to Galaxy's Ford F-150 RC Trucks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-for-lenovo-usb-connection-problems/"><u>Quick Fixes for Lenovo USB Connection Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/top-recommended-elearning-programs-for-aspiring-developers/"><u>Top Recommended eLearning Programs for Aspiring Developers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-beautiful-exterior-with-some-peculiarities-inside/"><u>Unveiling the Asus BW-16D1X-U Blu-Ray Drive - Beautiful Exterior with Some Peculiarities Inside</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The split layout of this particular keyboard can present a slight learning curve for users who need to be fluent touch typists, but it is easily one of the most comfortable and sleek keyboards available.</p><p> The keyboard has Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity for either Windows or macOS and can reportedly operate for up to two years on a single pair of AAA batteries. The long battery life is undoubtedly a plus, but the lack of backlighting is a bit of a drag.</p><p> The K860 features an integrated wristrest that is among the most comfortable. While it does provide excellent support and is something of a necessity with ergonomic keyboards, the inability to separate the wrist rest from the keyboard itself could present a problem if it ever wears out, forcing you to buy a new unit altogether.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver, Bluetooth | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> No</p><h2 id="Best-Bluetooth"><a href="#Best-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Best Bluetooth"></a>Best Bluetooth</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >Logitech K350 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vvGd6j3WPY7kvNcUe7rR9EtXw7Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/logitech-k350-wave-ergonomic-keyboard-with-unifying-wireless-technology---black-37ff3a8f592546ccb89727018658e217.jpg" >Logitech K350 Wave Ergonomic Keyboard with Unifying Wireless Technology - Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/13215113" >$50 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/keyboards/78012408?cid=us%253Acse%253Aqza7ob&source=connexity&channel=cse&adcampaign=CSE%255FConnexitycon&slpfid=3" >$40 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.adorama.com/lok350wk.html?slpfid=3" >$40 at Adorama.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Budget friendly</li><li>Low learning curve</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Occasional input lag</li></ul><p> The Logitech K350 is a good choice for anyone looking for a basic wireless keyboard with an ergonomic design. This keyboard is a single-piece unit, so you won’t have to spend much time re-learning how to type. Each key features a wave design that flows perfectly to the next, making long-term typing much more comfortable.</p><p> The keyboard also features a padded wrist rest and adjustable legs for comfort. The universal wireless receiver lets you connect mice and even other keyboards without using other USB dongles; great for computers where USB ports are at a premium.</p><p> The Logitech K350 uses two AAA batteries for power and can reportedly run for up to three years before swapping them out. The keyboard features dedicated media keys for streaming music and movies and fully customizable F keys to help streamline your workflow.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> Yes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Macs"><a href="#Best-for-Macs" class="headerlink" title="Best for Macs"></a>Best for Macs</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FoNm5Ll0b-0S90PKTGIDqCTXM2Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kinesis-freestyle2-blue-wireless-ergonomic-keyboard-for-mac-9-standard-separation-ecab2805a4244eda85035c256af27749.jpg" >KINESIS Freestyle2 Blue Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard for Mac (9&quot; Standard Separation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMVJYEW/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB00NMVJYEW" >$99 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kinesis-KB800PB-us-Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Split-Keyboard-for-PC/41539324?slfpid=3" >$89 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/989638/Kinesis-Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-For-PC/?cm_mmc=PLA-_-Google-_-Computer_Tablet_Accessories-_-989638&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv7HKttKB6QIVUl8NCh2Afg94EAQYBCABEgJKIvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" >$113 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Extensive compatibility</li><li>Awesome battery life</li><li>Dedicated text edit macro keys</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Membrane keys</li><li>Split layout isn’t for everyone</li></ul><p> Apple computer users should look at the Kinesis Freestyle2 blue wireless ergonomic keyboard with a bevy of Apple-specific keyboard shortcuts, including cut, copy, paste, and undo. Connecting to your Apple machine via Bluetooth 3.0, a single battery charge on the Kinesis should last around 300 hours or six months (based on two hours per day of typing).</p><p> You’ll immediately discover that the negative slope design reduces the required extension of your wrist to hit each key. Available with three different channels, the Bluetooth-based functionality allows for three devices to be synced at one time (switching between the devices requires the single press of a key). Additional buttons include a shortcut for hiding (and showing) the dock and advanced multimedia playback and volume controls.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Membrane | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless receiver | <strong>RGB:</strong> None | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> Yes</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/freestyle2-blue-review-4780187" >Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >KINESIS Gaming Freestyle Edge RGB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q3W8Bom-XJN_2to3Ie0pYQ79DRo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kinesis-usb-gaming-freestyle-edge-rgb-split-mechanical-keyboard-mx-blue-09e297410e95469492d64a80b1d35979.jpg" >KINESIS USB GAMING Freestyle Edge RGB Split Mechanical Keyboard (MX Blue) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4147386%7Cn326e10e09a2e4a42be05879465b0c31513%7CB07SXX7P6D" >$199 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Freestyle-Edge-RGB-Split-Keyboard/523723147?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=6236" >$199 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fully customizable</li><li>Tenting stands available</li><li>Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux compatible</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Reports of issues with SmartSet app</li><li>May be uncomfortable for those with larger hands</li></ul><p> Whether you’re a professional or hobbyist, gaming can take a toll on your wrists and hands. The Kinesis Freestyle Edge keyboard is here to keep you comfortable during all but the most intense gaming sessions. This keyboard has two separate pieces that can be placed in various configurations to feel more natural. The left section of the keyboard can be used on its own as a gamepad to make room for a larger mouse, microphone, or other equipment you may need. Both halves of the keyboard can be placed up to 20 inches apart for more comfortable typing and to make room for additional peripherals.</p><p> The keyboard features Cherry MX Blue switches for a clicky, tactile response and durability. Each of the 95 keys can be custom backlit with over 16.8 million color combinations and ten different effects. They can also be remapped on the fly with the SmartSet app, and up to nine other user profiles can be stored in the keyboard’s onboard 4MB memory. This keyboard features plug-and-play functionality for Windows, Mac, and Linux-based systems, so you don’t have to worry about downloading extra drivers or software.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Mechanical | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> USB | <strong>RGB:</strong> Per-Key | <strong>Tenkeys:</strong> Yes | <strong>Palm Rest:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dedicated Media Controls:</strong> No</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mice-for-macs-6753004" >The Best Mice for Macs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-an-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-an-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard"></a>What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997717/19272" target="_top" id="1997717">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997717" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997717/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage"></a><strong>Usage</strong></h3><p> Where will you be using this keyboard?

While you can use a keyboard for multiple purposes, you may enjoy customizing which one you buy based on how you will use it the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Mac-vs-PC"><a href="#Mac-vs-PC" class="headerlink" title="Mac vs. PC"></a><strong>Mac vs. PC</strong></h3><p> Do you have a Mac or a PC? While it seems like keyboards should be usable with both, that’s not always the case. You need to make sure whatever keyboard you buy is compatible with your system (this is usually a bigger problem for Macs rather than PCs). Additionally, the two operating systems have slightly different keys. While you can often use mapping software to alleviate these issues, you may want to purchase a keyboard specifically designed for your type of machine.</p><h3 id="Keyboard-size"><a href="#Keyboard-size" class="headerlink" title="Keyboard size"></a><strong>Keyboard size</strong></h3><p> Do you need a full-size keyboard, complete with a number pad? If you’re inputting numbers, you probably find the number pad vital. But if you’re used to typing on a laptop, it’s likely you barely use it. Do you need a foldable, portable keyboard? Or do you need something with a small footprint but not necessarily mobile? You can find ergonomic keyboards in all sizes—think about what you’ll need.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-keyboard-wrist-rests-4172684" >The Best Keyboard Wrist Rests of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Do ergonomic keyboards really help?<br> While there’s not enough evidence available to establish that ergonomic keyboards can prevent RSI, carpal tunnel, or other ailments, they have been shown to reduce strain on the body by allowing for more natural angles and positioning while typing. That said, if you experience symptoms like numbness or nerve pain, you should immediately consult your doctor.</li><li>How does an ergonomic keyboard differ from a regular keyboard?<br> Ergonomic keyboards separate the standard keyboard layout into two halves. Splitting the keys in half roughly around the center of the keyboard allows the designer to tilt each half in a way that encourages a more natural hand and wrist position when addressing the keys, and reduces joint and muscle strain while typing.</li><li>How can you adjust to using an ergonomic keyboard?<br> If possible, start by using an ergonomic keyboard in much the same way you would a standard keyboard, to give your hands (and brain) time to adapt to the slight differences in key layout. Then, when you’re generally familiar with the new deck, start adjusting the keyboard to best suit your hands and typing style; many ergonomic keyboards will allow you to adjust not only the horizontal tilt of the separate halves but also the vertical lift. Find the angle and height that are most comfortable for your hands and seated position.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-role-and-significance-of-blue-icons-in-fb-chats/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Role and Significance of Blue Icons in FB Chats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-master-the-art-of-gaming-best-monitors-and-tvs-for-xbox-series-x/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Master the Art of Gaming Best Monitors & TVs For Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-sharing-lifes-moments-with-your-online-audience/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Sharing Life's Moments with Your Online Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/a-critical-look-at-cyberpunk-2077-stunning-yet-imperfect-gem/"><u>A Critical Look at Cyberpunk 2077: Stunning Yet Imperfect Gem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/braving-sound-quality-with-jabras-tough-buddy/"><u>Braving Sound Quality with Jabra's Tough Buddy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/navigating-through-innovation-the-elite-selection-of-smart-spectacles/"><u>Navigating Through Innovation: The Elite Selection of Smart Spectacles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/online-tutorial-adding-youtube-playlists-to-your-site/"><u>Online Tutorial Adding YouTube Playlists to Your Site</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/petcube-economical-high-definition-pet-monitoring-system/"><u>Petcube Economical High Definition Pet Monitoring System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ideo-enhancements-grasping-green-screen-artistry-through-4-youtube-demos-for-2024/"><u>Pro Video Enhancements Grasping Green Screen Artistry Through 4 YouTube Demos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/selecting-speedsters-criteria-for-gaming-powerhouses/"><u>Selecting Speedsters: Criteria for Gaming Powerhouses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-complete-breakdown-and-insights-on-linksys-wrt1900acs-an-open-source-solution-for-home-networking/"><u>The Complete Breakdown and Insights on Linksys WRT1900ACS - An Open Source Solution for Home Networking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-for-getting-football-manager-2022-up-and-running-again/"><u>Troubleshooting Steps for Getting Football Manager 2022 Up and Running Again</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-tips-overcoming-iphone-remote-application-glitches-easily/"><u>Troubleshooting Tips: Overcoming iPhone Remote Application Glitches Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-create-stunning-videos-on-mac-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Updated Create Stunning Videos on Mac A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/what-does-a-blue-icon-signify-on-fb-messenger-in-2024/"><u>What Does a Blue Icon Signify on FB Messenger, In 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Projector Screen in 2024"></a>What to Look For in a Projector Screen in 2024</h2><p> There is no shortage of projector screens on the market. But not every screen will meet your needs or be suitable for them. So, keeping a few things to mind is important to ensure you purchase the right thing.</p><p> One of the first things you’ll have to decide is how and where you plan to use the screen. For example, will it have a permanent space in your living room, or do you want something for your backyard movie nights? This will help you narrow your choices and make the buying decision easier.</p><p> Then, you would want to consider the size. While a giant screen seems the most obvious choice, you don’t want it to overwhelm your space. But it’s equally important to make the most of your space. Fortunately, projector screens come in various sizes, so you’ll have no trouble finding one for your needs.</p><p> The ease of use and installation are also important. You don’t want to struggle to set the screen up or disassemble it. User reviews on shopping websites are typically helpful in determining how easy or difficult it is to assemble a screen. Plus, it’s crucial to make sure the screen will work with the projector you own.</p><p> Lastly, it’s a good idea to consider the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain%5F%28projection%5Fscreens%29" >gain of a screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Gain is the measurement of how much light a screen reflects. For example, if a screen reflects the same amount of light as a white magnesium oxide board, it’ll have a gain of 1.0. Screens can have a gain of less than or more than 1.0. Lower gain reduces the picture’s overall brightness but improves the black levels, whereas higher gain makes the image brighter but reduces the viewing angles.

The viewing angles are also great, and you won’t notice any color shift even while watching the screen from an angle.</p><p> Its durable aluminum frame and otherwise high-quality construction makes it look premium, despite costing significantly less than similarly-performing screens.</p><p> This projector is a permanent mount, most suitable for your basement, home theater setup, or rec room. You can disassemble it if you want to move it, but it’s not the type of projector you’ll want to take everywhere.

The picture will look great whether you are sitting head-on to the screen or at an angle. Plus, there is no light leakage thanks to the thick black covering on the back of the screen.</p><p> This portable, foldable projector screen can be assembled in minutes and has a carrying bag to store it. Moreover, its aluminum build is relatively lightweight, so you’ll have no trouble carrying it around or installing it.</p><p> The screen is also easy to clean with soap and water. So if it picks up a stain or mark, you’ll be able to get rid of it without trouble.</p><p> The only downside to the Elite Screens offering (and most consume-grade outdoor screens) is how it handles wind resistance. So while the company bundles stakes, support rope, and rings to secure it, these accessories are only helpful when you are in a backyard or lawn, where you can use the bundled stakes. You’ll have to make other arrangements on a concrete roof or balcony.</p><p> The Yard Master 2 is also not meant to be left out in the open for days.

But if you find some wrinkles after a long storage period, like when it gets delivered from the seller, you can iron them out.</p><p> The picture quality is good, and the included black frame helps absorb the overshoot. Additionally, while there is front and rear projection support, front projectors will be most suitable with the Vamvo screen.</p><p> In other features, you get wide viewing angles. And the company includes everything required to secure it when you are using it outdoors, such as guy lines and stakes.

Just blow up the screen, and you’re good to go. Among the various inflatable screen options on the market, we particularly like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Inflatable-Outdoor-Indoor-Theater-Projector/dp/B07GZZBQ7T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227964&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/894092/best-projector-screens/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Khomo Gear Outdoor Projector Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> It comes in two massive screen sizes, each of which can deliver a cinematic experience under the stars. In addition, the screen supports both front and rear projection, so you get plenty of flexibility.</p><p> Another plus point of this project screen is the relatively quiet blower, so it won’t hamper your experience of owning the screen. And it can be placed behind the screen, away from sight. Moreover, the screen is easy to set up, but you may need help due to the size.</p><p> The only issue you may face with Khomo Gear or any other brand’s inflatable projector screen is proper support in windy conditions. The bundled guy lines and stakes won’t always help as—compared to the metal-frame models we’ve already highlighted—the screen has a much bigger surface area and a lighter weight. Plus, the storage bag provided with the Khomo Gear screen could be bigger as it’s tough to put back the deflated screen in the bag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51o4ojctcql-_sl160_.jpg"                                     > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Inflatable Projector Screen</p><h5 id="Khomo-Gear-Outdoor-Projector-Screen-1"><a href="#Khomo-Gear-Outdoor-Projector-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="Khomo Gear Outdoor Projector Screen"></a>Khomo Gear Outdoor Projector Screen</h5><p>Getting the inflatable Khomo Gear Outdoor Projector Screen ready for projection is effortless.

Being a premium Samsung smartphone, the <a class="link"   href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-basic-guidebook-to-live-selling-in-todays-digital-world/" >Galaxy Z Flip 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is getting plenty of love from accessory manufacturers, and there is no dearth of <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-ending-your-insta-saga-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deactivation/" >cases for the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, not all cases are created equal. Choosing the right one requires careful consideration.</p><p> The first step is to determine the level of protection you need. Rugged cases offer maximum protection but will make your phone bulky, while slim cases add minimal bulk but may not help in a serious drop. You don’t necessarily need to opt for the extremes; a good balance between protection and bulk is ideal for most people.</p><p> In other case types, you can go with a clear case if you don’t want to hide the phone’s design or color behind a case. Similarly, hybrid cases can help get you the benefits of two or more case types in one.</p><p> Some people value hinge protection for foldables like the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you need it, look for cases with a built-in hinge cover, as it’s not a very common feature. You may also want a built-in kickstand for hands-free media consumption, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-learn-how-to-change-number-on-tiktok-with-working-methods/" >wireless charging support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or lanyard holes for straps.</p><p> Moreover, your budget will significantly impact your purchase. Fortunately, you can find <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-best-free-tool-your-android-unhindered-for-2024/" >high-quality cases at all price points <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so you don’t necessarily need to spend big bucks to get a good case for your phone.</p><p> Finally, choose a case that complements your style.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>21</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

While the Z Flip 6 has a clamshell-style form factor, the Z Fold 6 has a larger landscape folding design. The two phones share many features but have quite a few differences. For example, the Z Fold 6 has an extra telephoto shooter, a slightly larger battery, UWB support, and an additional selfie shooter on the cover screen. For most people, the design will be the most significant differentiating factor between the two phones.</p><h3 id="Will-a-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-case-protect-the-hinge"><a href="#Will-a-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-case-protect-the-hinge" class="headerlink" title="Will a Galaxy Z Flip 6 case protect the hinge?"></a>Will a Galaxy Z Flip 6 case protect the hinge?</h3><p> Hinge protection depends on whether a case includes a hinge cover. For example, cases like the Spigen Tough Armor Pro and the Supcase Unicon Beetle Pro will protect the Galaxy Z Flip 6 hinge. However, a hinge cover isn’t available in all cases. So, if that’s important for you, choose your case wisely.</p><h3 id="Can-I-use-a-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-case-with-the-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#Can-I-use-a-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-case-with-the-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="Can I use a Galaxy Z Flip 5 case with the Galaxy Z Flip 6?"></a>Can I use a Galaxy Z Flip 5 case with the Galaxy Z Flip 6?</h3><p> While you may be able to fit the Galaxy Z Flip 5 cases on the Z Flip 6, it’s better to use a case designed for it, as the latter has very minor design tweaks.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-a-beginners-guide-to-blending-images-crafting-videographics-in-pixiz-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Beginner's Guide to Blending Images, Crafting Videographics in Pixiz for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-screen-shot-on-android-devices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Screen Shot on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-secure-and-detailed-best-ways-to-document-fb-call-footage-for-2024/"><u>[New] Secure & Detailed Best Ways to Document FB Call Footage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-fast-setup-moving-media-from-pc-to-your-iphone/"><u>[Updated] Fast Setup Moving Media From PC To Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-retro-tech-treasure/"><u>[Updated] Retro Tech Treasure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-in-game-footage-secrets-of-the-skilled-videographer/"><u>2024 Approved In-Game Footage Secrets of the Skilled Videographer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-burner-reviewed-stylish-features-with-a-touch-of-quirky-functionality/"><u>Asus BW-16D1X-U Blu-Ray Burner Reviewed - Stylish Features with a Touch of Quirky Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/boost-your-internet-experience-discover-the-power-of-the-portable-ourlink-u631-wi-fi-device/"><u>Boost Your Internet Experience: Discover the Power of the Portable Ourlink U631 Wi-Fi Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/breaking-down-4k-resolution-with-hcwxf991/"><u>Breaking Down 4K Resolution with HC_WXF991</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-4k-action-exploration-with-akasos-ek7000/"><u>Budget-Friendly 4K Action Exploration with AKASO's EK7000</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/compact-tp-link-wr902ac-travel-router-portable-wi-fi-on-the-go/"><u>Compact TP-Link WR902AC Travel Router - Portable Wi-Fi on the Go</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-samsung-q60r-series-the-ultimate-4k-smart-tv-for-gamers/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Samsung Q60R Series - The Ultimate 4K Smart TV for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-the-nokia-31-smartphone-a-top-choice-for-first-time-users/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of the Nokia 3.1 Smartphone - A Top Choice for First-Time Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/whats-new-in-youtube-tv-updates-and-features/"><u>What's New in YouTube TV Updates & Features?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/be-monetization-mastery-secrets-success-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Monetization Mastery Secrets Success for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market.

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087262/19272" target="_top" id="2087262">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087262" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087262/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118325/7443" target="_top" id="2118325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118325/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-apocalypse-arena-top-8-zombie-games-showdown-ranked/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Apocalypse Arena Top 8 Zombie Games Showdown Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-guide-exploring-every-nook-and-cranny-of-stardew-valley-particularly-ginger-island/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide Exploring Every Nook and Cranny of Stardew Valley, Particularly Ginger Island</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-professional-tips-for-using-luts-in-adobe-after-effects/"><u>[New] Professional Tips for Using LUTs in Adobe After Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimizing-vimeo-video-speed-rates/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimizing Vimeo Video Speed Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-rapid-progression-in-tiktok-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Rapid Progression in TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-your-potential-with-these-leading-cost-free-editions/"><u>2024 Approved Unlock Your Potential with These Leading Cost-Free Editions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/amazons-chromecast-rivals-2024-edition/"><u>Amazon's Chromecast Rivals - 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/discovering-new-audio-delights-with-avantree-aria/"><u>Discovering New Audio Delights with Avantree Aria</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/easy-to-use-at-lp120xusb-for-digital-vinyl-lovers/"><u>Easy-to-Use AT-LP120XUSB for Digital Vinyl Lovers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-your-facebook-profile-choosing-top-apps-for-like-growth-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Facebook Profile Choosing Top Apps for Like Growth for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/exploring-the-features-of-barnes-and-nobles-nook-glowlight-3-an-ideal-book-companion-after-sunset/"><u>Exploring the Features of Barnes & Noble's Nook GlowLight 3 - An Ideal Book Companion After Sunset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/garmin-vivoactive-veil-upbeat-workouts-track-tune-in-and-enhance-your-fitness-journey/"><u>Garmin Vivoactive Veil Upbeat Workouts: Track, Tune In & Enhance Your Fitness Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-videos-not-playing-on-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Fix Videos Not Playing on Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/is-vonage-continuously-outperforming-competitors-in-the-voip-industry/"><u>Is Vonage Continuously Outperforming Competitors in the VoIP Industry?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/mastering-budget-phones-thorough-review-of-the-powerful-oneplus-nord-n100/"><u>Mastering Budget Phones: Thorough Review of the Powerful OnePlus Nord N100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/testing-the-waters-a-thorough-assessment-of-the-jackery-powerbar-and-its-built-in-ac-connection/"><u>Testing the Waters: A Thorough Assessment of the Jackery PowerBar and Its Built-In AC Connection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/thermopro-tp67-review/"><u>ThermoPro TP67 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/unlocking-potential-chatgpts-6-innovative-uses-in-analytics/"><u>Unlocking Potential: ChatGPT's 6 Innovative Uses in Analytics</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The market for 17-inch laptops might not be massive, but the LG Gram 17 certainly makes a compelling argument in their favor. Traditionally the two largest drawbacks to 17-inch laptops are the physical footprint, and the weight, both of which make these large laptops less than portable. The LG Gram does away with both of these problems with its 2.95 pound body and thin bezels, packing a 17-inch screen in a 15-inch body.</p><p> LG further supports this laptop with a better than average suite of specs, including an 8th gen i7-8565 processor, 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM. This laptop unsurprisingly omits a discrete graphics card in its slender 0.7-inch thick frame, so don’t plan on doing any gaming or similarly heavy graphics work, but it should otherwise stand up to just about any task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bPwgN393oESXdTRdBMHH9_o-50k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-4-65036fddfdad4e9c904b1e4388426085.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-A-thoughtful-approach-to-larger-laptops"><a href="#Design-A-thoughtful-approach-to-larger-laptops" class="headerlink" title="Design :A thoughtful approach to larger laptops"></a><strong>Design</strong> :<strong>A thoughtful approach to larger laptops</strong></h2><p> Without question, the first thing you will notice when you take the LG Gram 17 out of its box is how light it is. Weighing less than 3 pounds, it’s trivial to lift, hold, and carry with one hand. For reference, a current-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs in at just over 4 pounds, so it’s a funny feeling to hold a larger laptop that weighs less. There haven’t been any great miracles worked here—the reduced weight comes at the cost of a flimsier feeling construction that lacks the sturdiness of heavier laptops.</p><p> Despite the slim frame, the LG Gram 17 still manages a fair amount of connectivity. The left side of the device contains a USB-A, HDMI, and USB-C ports, while the right side houses two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader. This may not be an overabundance of connectivity options, but it’s more than we’ve come to expect from modern laptops.</p><p> The market for 17-inch laptops might not be massive, but the LG Gram 17 certainly makes a compelling argument in their favor.</p><p> The keyboard takes advantage of the sizeable frame and provides a full-size layout complete with numpad. The keys themselves are a bit on the mushier side, but after a bit of acclimation, we were able to type quickly enough to not be an issue. One peculiarity that might bothersome, however, is the placement of the touchpad square in the middle instead of aligned with the main key rows. This did cause us to accidentally move the cursor while typing on plenty of occasions.</p><p> Finally, the fingerprint sensor, located directly on the power button on the top right corner of the keyboard, performed fairly well in our tests. This placement, although precarious in theory, didn’t cause any mishaps during our testing. This placement is actually somewhat advantageous—if you turn on the laptop using a finger registered to the fingerprint sensor, it wakes straight into Windows seamlessly without even hitting the login prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NZFtzU5S2IX_YcC_7X7i2oB0j1o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-2-d528eacd17e849099026bd1df6142200.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047361/19272" target="_top" id="2047361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-help-needed"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-help-needed" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :No help needed"></a><strong>Setup</strong> <strong>Process</strong> :<strong>No help needed</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 arrives in a minimally packaged box containing only the essentials: The laptop itself, the charger, a manual, and an adapter for the USB-C port. LG definitely gets high marks on setup, requiring minimal steps to get set up and begin using your device right away. You will be prompted to enter the standard information any Windows laptop will ask—like your Wi-Fi credentials, a username and password, your timezone, and if you’d like, a fingerprint impression.</p><p> Once you’ve completed setup, you’ll be introduced to the LG Update Center, designed to handle both Windows updates and updates to LG’s software on the laptop. Thankfully, this software is very discreet and hands-off, not overstepping its intended purpose. LG is very light on 3rd party software bundled with the laptop, containing only a handful of bespoke applications which we will cover in greater detail in the Software section. Suffice it to say, there is a lot less bloatware than we normally find on laptops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mt69Vhar3JM30uFdBWA58_wPdYg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-5-f2352e95cadc4e2b99d738b0238fb7bf.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Display-A-joy-to-use"><a href="#Display-A-joy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Display :A joy to use"></a><strong>Display</strong> :<strong>A joy to use</strong></h2><p> The large, bright 17-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display is definitely the centerpiece of the LG Gram 17. It strikes the perfect balance of size to resolution ratio. Having a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 definitely gives the feeling that you have more room to play around with.</p><p> We were impressed by how bright and vivid colors were on this display when watching video content. The IPS display is sharp, featuring attractive colors and satisfying contrast. Keep in mind though that while watching most standard 16:9 content, you aren’t taking advantage of all 17 inches of the display, and will see black bars on the top and bottom.</p><p> The large, bright 17-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display is definitely the centerpiece of the LG Gram 17.</p><p> Productivity is definitely where this laptop shines. The large, tall screen makes it really perfect for getting things done. It’s easy to throw a couple of applications side by side and have plenty of real estate to work with. Even if you don’t feel like you’re missing much on your current laptop, it’s definitely nice to be able to scroll less and see more at-a-glance.</p><p> The IPS display also performs admirably by most other metrics that buyers will care about, such as a maximum brightness high enough to be usable outdoors. Additionally, the display looks great from off-angles, losing very little brightness when viewed from the sides, and showing no signs of color shift.</p><h2 id="Performance-Ready-to-work-but-not-to-game"><a href="#Performance-Ready-to-work-but-not-to-game" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Ready to work (but not to game)"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Ready to work (but not to game)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 performed well in our tests, managing a 3,851 score in PCMark 10. As mentioned previously, this laptop is best suited for productivity-related tasks. The absence of a dedicated graphics card means that it won’t be able to keep up in anything beyond casual games and very light video editing workloads, but so long as you avoid these types of tasks you shouldn’t really notice any shortcomings. The 16GB of RAM and 8th gen Intel i7 made using the Gram 17 a fast, responsive experience in everyday and work-related tasks.</p><p> We did nonetheless test the LG Gram 17 in some less demanding games, such as Slay the Spire, a roguelike card game with relatively undemanding graphics. We were able to play the game, but definitely noted some lag that made gameplay a little less pleasant.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4DSmBdI2ZVvCXO9PXT1iEnSCRxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-6-5381cd4656aa4307ba017acf8ce77c4b.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Productivity-The-Gram’s-sweet-spot"><a href="#Productivity-The-Gram’s-sweet-spot" class="headerlink" title="Productivity :The Gram’s sweet spot"></a><strong>Productivity</strong> :<strong>The Gram’s sweet spot</strong></h2><p> Having 16GB of Memory and a 512GB SSD makes the Gram a great choice for productivity purposes. We had no problem working with many browser windows open at the same time and switching back and forth between different applications. Shoppers looking to find a laptop with ample screen real estate and the specs necessary to deliver good performance now and into the future will be pleased with what the LG Gram 17 offers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Sorry-what-was-that"><a href="#Audio-Sorry-what-was-that" class="headerlink" title="Audio :Sorry, what was that?"></a><strong>Audio</strong> :<strong>Sorry, what was that?</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/all-about-speakers-4125129" >speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on The LG Gram 17 are an afterthought at best, offering meek sounding audio originating from ill-placed speaker grills on the bottom. To make matters worse, these speakers are easily covered and muffled when it sits on your lap. Even when the stars aligned and we happened to leave the speakers unobstructed, we weren’t impressed by the sound offered. In short, get ready to use headphones or external speakers, and don’t plan on having any movie viewing parties with it either.</p><p> Keep in mind though that while watching most standard 16:9 content, you aren’t taking advantage of all 17 inches of the display, and will see black bars on the top and bottom.</p><h2 id="Network-Everything-you’d-expect"><a href="#Network-Everything-you’d-expect" class="headerlink" title="Network :Everything you’d expect"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Everything you’d expect</strong></h2><p> Wi-Fi on the LG Gram 17 gave us no trouble, offering a strong signal and speeds in any of the public and private environments we tested in. LG uses the Intel Wireless AC 9560 Wi-Fi adapter, the fastest of such chips currently on offer from Intel. This Wi-Fi adapter has a theoretical max speed of 1.73Gbps and offers a 2x2 antenna configuration, though you’re unlikely to ever hit such a high download speed.</p><h2 id="Camera-Bare-minimum"><a href="#Camera-Bare-minimum" class="headerlink" title="Camera :Bare minimum"></a><strong>Camera</strong> :<strong>Bare minimum</strong></h2><p> The 720p webcam on the LG Gram 17 is nothing to write home about, and probably won’t be the platform you use for taking your next headshot or dating profile picture. The camera has a tendency to blow out the background in an attempt to keep the subject in focus, and there is a plainly visible amount of noise in the image even in generous daylight conditions. Nonetheless, it will serve fine for teleconferencing purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q5UD3HDcQsoXbP-_uvKqYsR9J6w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-17-Inch-Thin-Laptop-3-de338d995c0544ee8052e30def24ad5f.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 17"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Beyond-plentiful"><a href="#Battery-Beyond-plentiful" class="headerlink" title="Battery :Beyond plentiful"></a><strong>Battery</strong> :<strong>Beyond plentiful</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 is equipped with a more than capable battery that offers up to 19.5 hrs of battery life, according to LG. In our tests, the laptop averaged around 14 hours during mixed daily use—still quite a great deal. This is likely due to a mixture of the larger than average battery, lack of a discrete graphics card, and an energy-efficient display. This is about as good as you can hope for in a laptop, to be honest, and a surprising achievement for such a light and thin one. If time between charges is a concern for you, take note.</p><p> When running Battery Eater Pro to push the laptop to its limits, it kicked the bucket in just over 2 hours and 30 minutes. This may seem like a very short time, but it’s still considerably better than any of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-17-inch-laptops-832683" >other 17-inch laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested using this brutal benchmark.</p><h2 id="Software-Standard-Windows-with-some-unique-features"><a href="#Software-Standard-Windows-with-some-unique-features" class="headerlink" title="Software: Standard Windows with some unique features"></a><strong>Software: Standard Windows with some unique features</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 17 comes with a fairly vanilla installation of Windows 10 Home, offering very little in the way of custom third party applications or other types of bloat. In our eyes, this is a big plus, as having numerous added applications can slow systems (and users) down, and often serve as yet another piece of software to keep up to date.</p><p> The three main pieces of software we did find pre-installed were the LG Update Center, LG Control Center, and Reader Mode. LG Update Center helps manage Windows updates in addition to driver updates, and does so without being overly complicated or intrusive.</p><p> As it stands, you won’t find a lighter, smaller 17-inch laptop than the LG Gram 17.</p><p> The LG Control Center gives users quick access to common system functions like power management, Windows security, and system settings. You can control the volume, disable the touchpad temporarily, manage screen and keyboard backlight brightness, and more. This might not be altogether_necessary_ , but users can simply not use it if they wish.</p><p> Finally, the LG Gram 17 comes with Reader Mode as a pre-installed app that runs in the background on startup and is accessible from the taskbar. Switching it on changes the color temperature of the display to filter out blue light (by default) and make night-time and low-light usage more pleasant. You can also take control of the adjustments that Reader Mode makes, controlling the brightness, contrast, and gamma adjustments for red, green, and blue independently. This seems excessive, but we can’t fault LG too much for giving users more control.</p><h2 id="Price-Lighter-laptop-bigger-price-tag"><a href="#Price-Lighter-laptop-bigger-price-tag" class="headerlink" title="Price: Lighter laptop, bigger price tag"></a><strong>Price: Lighter laptop, bigger price tag</strong></h2><p> At an MSRP of $1,700, the LG Gram 17 is not particularly affordable, and even less so when compared to similar options in the market. For this price, we would normally expect to get a discrete graphics card and the expanded possibilities that come with it. The premium you are paying for in this case isn’t sheer price-to-performance but portability and form factor. On these fronts, the LG Gram 17 definitely shines.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151872/7443" target="_top" id="2151872">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151872" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151872/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-Gram-17-vs-ASUS-VivoBook-Pro-17"><a href="#LG-Gram-17-vs-ASUS-VivoBook-Pro-17" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 17 vs. ASUS VivoBook Pro 17"></a><strong>LG Gram 17 vs. ASUS VivoBook Pro 17</strong></h2><p> These two laptops share very little in common other than both having 17-inch displays and the same Intel processor. The VivoBook has a lower resolution (1920 x 1080 versus 2560 x 1600) display, larger bezels, chunkier body, smaller battery, and weighs over 50 percent more (4.6 versus 2.95 pounds). The VivoBook, on the other hand, has an Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics card and costs far less ($1,099 vs $1,699).</p><p> If form factor and portability are higher on your list, the LG probably still wins out, but where price-to-performance is concerned, the VivoBook Pro 17 wins handily.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-vivobook-pro-17-review-4775930" >Asus VivoBook Pro 17 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A featherweight champion for productivity.</strong></p><p> As it stands, you won’t find a lighter, smaller 17-inch laptop than the LG Gram 17.

The question is, how can you convert a physical book into a digital copy yourself? It turns out there are at least three ways to do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-You-Should-Digitize-Your-Books"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Digitize-Your-Books" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Digitize Your Books"></a>Why You Should Digitize Your Books</h2><p> I love physical books, but I also love my <a class="link"   href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-transforming-footage-your-guide-to-ken-burns-in-camtasa-9/" >eReader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Digital books have an undeniable set of convenient advantages. Not just that, but also every time you handle a physical book you wear it out. If you have books that are rare, expensive, or are no longer for sale, those are all great reasons to preserve them digitally.</p><p> Of course, if a book already exists as an official ebook, you can simply purchase it in digital form. That said, ebooks are still expensive in many cases. They also often have DRM (<a class="link"   href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-leveraging-your-smartphone-a-2024-tutorial-on-youtubing-money/" >Digital Rights Management <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) except for some publishers, such as Tor Books. If you make your own copy of a physical book you own, you save that additional fee, and you can read it on devices like tablets, annotate it without harming the original, and pretty much anything else.</p><p> We’re not in a position to offer legal advice, and it’s always your responsibility to check the laws where you live. However, the doctrine of Fair Use in the US generally allows you to make copies of media that you own for personal use. Fair Use is, however, complicated, and scanning an entire book might make it less likely to qualify as Fair Use. However, if it’s strictly for your personal use, does not affect the market for that book, and you don’t distribute it illegally, you should be fine. Digitization specialists Digital Library Vision have a fantastic deep-dive into the <a class="link"   href="https://www.libraryvision.org/digitization/book-scanning-legality/" >legal aspects of scanning books <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Non-Destructive-Scanning-With-an-App"><a href="#Non-Destructive-Scanning-With-an-App" class="headerlink" title="Non-Destructive Scanning With an App"></a>Non-Destructive Scanning With an App</h2><p> While you can absolutely use a traditional scanner to scan a book, that rarely results in something that looks good or is pleasant to read. Thanks to the way books are bound, they don’t scan very well. This means you need the right software to process these scans into a good format. Specialized applications like <a class="link"   href="https://scanpapyrus.com/" >ScanPapyrus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the (now defunct) <a class="link"   href="https://scantailor.org/" >ScanTailor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were made for this purpose.</p><p> These scanning apps have features that let you de-skew, color correct, and clean up your book scans so they look good on a screen. That being said, how many people still own flatbed scanners? Chances are you’re much better off using your phone’s camera and the right app to digitize your books. Especially if you only have a small handful to process. You can use something like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html" >Adobe Scanner app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which has a <a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/hub/scan-digitize-textbooks.html" >specialized book mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that lets you quickly make a PDF with automatically processed pages from a book.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959778/19272" target="_top" id="1959778">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959778" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959778/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Destructive-Scanning-by-Removing-the-Book’s-Binding"><a href="#Destructive-Scanning-by-Removing-the-Book’s-Binding" class="headerlink" title="Destructive Scanning by Removing the Book’s Binding"></a>Destructive Scanning by Removing the Book’s Binding</h2><p> If you have a book that’s already falling apart, or you don’t mind undoing its binding, then the optimal solution is to scan each separated page using a flatbed scanner. This can be time-consuming, but if it’s a book with lots of illustrations or artwork, this might actually be the best way. This is also more likely to be the way to go for really old books right before you send them to be bound properly again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Buying-a-Specialized-Non-Destructive-Book-Scanner"><a href="#Buying-a-Specialized-Non-Destructive-Book-Scanner" class="headerlink" title="Buying a Specialized Non-Destructive Book Scanner"></a>Buying a Specialized Non-Destructive Book Scanner</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/czur.jpg"                      alt="CZUR Aura Pro Portable Book Scanner"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>CZUR</p><p> The last good option is to buy a dedicated book scanner. You can find these for a few hundred dollars apiece. You get the scanner plus the software, and this is probably the fastest way to digitize books. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/CZUR-Auto-Flatten-Fingerprint-Technologies-Multi-Language/dp/B0B2WBG8P9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004023&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-digitize-your-physical-books/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Czur Aura Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is around $250 and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/CZUR-Professional-Document-Auto-Flatten-Languages/dp/B0BM92YPHW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004023&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-digitize-your-physical-books/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >CZUR ET24 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will run you a cool $650! Clearly, this option is for those who are serious about digitizing their books, but if you have a large collection and don’t want to unbind your books, this seems like the way to go.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-fixing-inaccurate-avatar-showcasing-in-fb-messages/"><u>[Updated] Fixing Inaccurate Avatar Showcasing in FB Messages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-silver-winners-prime-dvd-software-for-sierra-os/"><u>[Updated] Silver Winners Prime Dvd Software for Sierra OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-affordable-mobile-apps-to-boost-your-images-visual-impact/"><u>2024 Approved 10 Affordable Mobile Apps to Boost Your Image's Visual Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2024s-ultimate-selection-of-premium-mesh-wi-fi-setups/"><u>2024'S Ultimate Selection of Premium Mesh Wi-Fi Setups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/asus-ac88u-triple-band-router-in-depth-performance-analysis-and-gameplay-enhancement/"><u>Asus AC88U Triple-Band Router - In-Depth Performance Analysis & Gameplay Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/boost-your-productivity-a-step-by-step-tutorial-on-chatgpt-and-microsoft-word-synergy/"><u>Boost Your Productivity: A Step-by-Step Tutorial on ChatGPT and Microsoft Word Synergy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-evaluation-the-ultimate-scanner-solution-for-home-office-and-smbs/"><u>Comprehensive Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 Evaluation: The Ultimate Scanner Solution for Home Office & SMBs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-samsung-ru7300-55-4k-uhd-smart-led-tv-analysis-are-the-unique-features-justified/"><u>Comprehensive Samsung RU7300 55 4K UHD Smart LED TV Analysis - Are the Unique Features Justified?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-luxury.techidaily.com/einfaches-zurucksetzen-ihrer-samsung-t7-eine-bequemere-option-als-das-herstellerwerkzeug/"><u>Einfaches Zurücksetzen Ihrer Samsung T7: Eine Bequemere Option Als Das Herstellerwerkzeug</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-words-to-memories-recording-with-iphone/"><u>In 2024, From Words to Memories Recording with iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/precision-and-power-choosing-best-kung-fu-games-ranked-for-2024/"><u>Precision & Power Choosing Best Kung Fu Games Ranked for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/rapidly-engageturn-off-bings-ai-window-chat/"><u>Rapidly Engage/Turn Off Bing's AI Window Chat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/review-of-beyerdynamic-mmx-300-pro-headphones-outstanding-sound-and-basic-composition-examined/"><u>Review of Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro Headphones: Outstanding Sound & Basic Composition Examined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/understanding-the-key-distinctions-between-ipad-and-ipad-air/"><u>Understanding the Key Distinctions Between iPad and iPad Air</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unfolding-the-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-experience-a-revolutionary-design-with-imperfections/"><u>Unfolding the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold Experience: A Revolutionary Design with Imperfections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/unleashing-long-conversations-analyzing-jabras-speak-25/"><u>Unleashing Long Conversations: Analyzing Jabra's Speak 25</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/why-skagen-falster-2-deserves-a-spot-on-your-radar-an-elegant-contender-against-apple-devices/"><u>Why Skagen Falster 2 Deserves a Spot on Your Radar - An Elegant Contender Against Apple Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Think Again!"></a>Should We Always Use the Quick Play Button on Netflix? Think Again!</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Speeding up Netflix playback isn’t ideal for enjoying shows and movies intended to be watched at normal speed.</li><li>Visual narratives aren’t just about information but also timing and beats that are disrupted at higher speeds.</li><li>Content at high speeds can resemble motion smoothing, distort perception, and detract from the intended experience.</li></ul><p> You may have noticed that it’s possible to speed up Netflix playback, similar to how you can on services like YouTube. However, if you’re thinking about fast-forwarding through your Netflix binge, here’s why you should think twice.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-People-Do-This"><a href="#Why-Do-People-Do-This" class="headerlink" title="Why Do People Do This?"></a>Why Do People Do This?</h2><p> Clearly, Netflix isn’t going to offer a feature for no reason, and as I mentioned, other video streaming platforms also offer a way to speed up playback, or slow it down, of course.</p><p> This happens with a pitch adjustment, so it doesn’t sound like everyone’s breathing helium, but everything moves more quickly. As I write this, the fastest speed Netflix allows is 1.5 times normal, which should save you 20 minutes out of every hour.</p><p> That’s a lot of time saved if you’re on YouTube and trying to learn something efficiently. However, if you’re trying to enjoy a show or a movie, and aren’t on a publication deadline to write a recap for some blog somewhere, it’s not the best idea. If you’re the pragmatic sort, you might be wondering what the actual problem is here, and I’m glad you asked!</p><h2 id="Timing-Is-Everything-in-Visual-Narrative"><a href="#Timing-Is-Everything-in-Visual-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Timing Is Everything in Visual Narrative"></a>Timing Is Everything in Visual Narrative</h2><p> One of the main reasons for this is that a story in video form isn’t just a transfer of information. A story has literal beats in real-time as you watch it. The amount of time something takes for something to play out, the length of a pause between lines, how long the camera lingers on a person’s face—these are all deliberate. The same goes for actual dialogue, which can also become hard to understand when sped up. As if the <a class="link"   href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-photos-files-from-oppo-a18-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/" >plague of inaudible dialogue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> wasn’t bad enough!</p><p> So if you speed up a movie or series, you’re not seeing it the way it was intended.

Even worse, the movement of characters and the physics of objects all look wrong. It’s cheesy and a little disconcerting. So, for the same reasons you shouldn’t watch a movie with smooth motion switched on, you shouldn’t watch it at a faster speed than intended.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424533">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424533">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424533.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424533%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424533/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Just-Relax-and-Enjoy-the-Show-Not-FOMO"><a href="#Just-Relax-and-Enjoy-the-Show-Not-FOMO" class="headerlink" title="Just Relax and Enjoy the Show (Not FOMO)"></a>Just Relax and Enjoy the Show (Not FOMO)</h2><p> Modern streaming is a massive convenience, but it’s also the source of anxiety for some of us.

People also have a tendency to watch (or even listen) to services like Netflix while doing other things, based on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking" >myth that the human brain can multitask <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> I’ll let you in on a secret—it’s OK not to see everything. You can just take things at your own pace and watch them when you have the time to actually enjoy them. I’ve still only seen the first season of <em>Stranger Things,</em> and I’m at least two seasons behind on <em>The Witcher</em>, though I’ve heard I might not be missing much when it comes to the latter!</p><p> The off-chance of spoilers notwithstanding, there’s just nothing important enough about staying up to date with these shows that would make me watch them at high speed to squeeze more episodes in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148638/16836" target="_top" id="2148638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148638/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="If-You-Must-Here’s-​​​​​​How-to-Speed-Up-Netflix-Shows"><a href="#If-You-Must-Here’s-​​​​​​How-to-Speed-Up-Netflix-Shows" class="headerlink" title="If You Must, Here’s ​​​​​​How to Speed Up Netflix Shows"></a>If You Must, Here’s ​​​​​​How to Speed Up Netflix Shows</h2><p> There’s a chance that when you read the title of this piece, you thought to yourself “you can speed up Netflix?” So for completeness’ sake, if you have a good reason to want faster playback, or perhaps more likely slightly slower playback, here’s how to do it.</p><p> First, this only works on the Netflix web player, and iOS and Android apps. So if you want to do this on your Apple TV, Android box, or using a Smart TV app, I’m afraid you’re out of luck. One potential workaround is to use your smart TV’s web browser, which might work depending on how advanced it is. Before you say it, I also thought it might work while casting from my phone, but the function doesn’t seem to work that way. At least it didn’t for me.</p><p> With that out of the way, all you have to do while something is playing is pause the video. You’ll see a set of controls at the bottom of the screen. Select this icon that looks like a speedometer. Also, it says “speed” on it too, which is another strong clue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/img_0487.PNG"                      alt="IMG_0487"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now you should see this slider, letting you tune the playback speed from 0.5x to 1.5x.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/img_0486.PNG"                      alt="IMG_0486"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><hr><p> You know what?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134495/18498" target="_top" id="2134495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134495/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-ice-cream-capture-gadget-detailed-examination-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ice Cream Capture Gadget Detailed Examination for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-visionary-software-solutions-for-virtual-meetings/"><u>[Updated] Visionary Software Solutions for Virtual Meetings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-premier-intro-list-for-panzoids/"><u>2024 Approved The Premier Intro List for Panzoids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/2024s-ultimate-picks-expertly-curated-list-of-home-theater-pcs/"><u>2024'S Ultimate Picks: Expertly Curated List of Home Theater PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-lighting-showcase-expert-insights-on-the-taotronics-tt-dl16-led-lamp/"><u>Cutting Edge Lighting Showcase: Expert Insights on the TaoTronics TT-DL16 LED Lamp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-the-incredible-features-of-the-2019-apple-ipad-air-a-gadget-geeks-dream-multimedia-device/"><u>Discover the Incredible Features of the 2019 Apple iPad Air: A Gadget Geek's Dream Multimedia Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-the-leading-unwired-phone-models-for-a-crystal-clear-call/"><u>Discover the Leading Unwired Phone Models for a Crystal Clear Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/expert-insight-unboxing-the-ultimate-speed-amazon-fire-tv-cube-evaluation/"><u>Expert Insight: Unboxing the Ultimate Speed - Amazon Fire TV Cube Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-harnessing-microsoft-teams-power-with-simple-snap-camera-use/"><u>In 2024, Harnessing Microsoft Teams' Power with Simple Snap Camera Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-lg-watch-style-the-benchmark-for-wearable-tech-with-wear-os-evolution/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of LG Watch Style - The Benchmark for Wearable Tech with Wear OS Evolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/iphone-13-examined-a-thorough-review-of-specs-and-user-experience/"><u>IPhone 13 Examined: A Thorough Review of Specs and User Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/iphone-tricks-how-to-program-precise-text-reminders-and-alerts/"><u>IPhone Tricks: How to Program Precise Text Reminders & Alerts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/kobo-clara-colour-e-reader-breakdown-a-detailed-review/"><u>Kobo Clara Colour E-Reader Breakdown - A Detailed Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/plants-vs-zombies-comedy-hit-in-neighborville-a-review-of-the-ultimate-veggie-shooter-game/"><u>Plants Vs.
