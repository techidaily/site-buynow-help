##  What to Look for in a Smart Sprinkler Controller in 2023

 A smart sprinkler controller makes it easy for you to manage your lawn. They're capable of far more than just turning on or off your sprinklers with the press of a button, with controllers having a variety of features you can take advantage of.

 Convenience and ease of use are the first factors you'll want to consider. You want a sprinkler controller that's easy to set up and control. You shouldn't have to spend hours reading the manual or rearranging your yard just to get it to work. The best controllers will be user-friendly and intuitive.

 Just as importantly, look for controllers that allow you to access its features in a way that's best for you. This includes from your phone or another mobile device, a touch screen, an online interface, or voice control. If you want voice control, make sure the sprinkler controller is compatible with your voice assistant. You'll also want to see if it integrates into your smart home ecosystem if you have one.

 You should also be able to set schedules for your sprinklers to turn on and off. Some sprinklers can automatically adjust their schedules based on the weather, which is an impressive feature. They will use weather forecast services to accurately predict when your lawn needs watering and then adjust accordingly. Your smart sprinkler controller should also be able to track your water usage to help you stay on top of your consumption.

 Not only do these features save on your water bill, but it also saves a lot of time and effort in turning your sprinkler schedules on and off manually based on the weather. Just getting rid of that frustration from many normal sprinkler controllers can be worth the upgrade to a smart one.

 Now that you know what to look for, let's take a look at the best smart sprinkler controllers available.

Rachio

| Pros                                            | Cons                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ✓ Easy installation precise weather forecasting | ✗ On the pricer side |
| ✓ Large number of useful features               |                      |
| ✓ Precise weather forecasting                   |                      |

 If you're looking for a highly functional controller that could cut your water bill in half, then installing the [Rachio 3 16-Zone Smart Sprinkler Controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ5K355?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is your best bet. It's a bit expensive at $230, but the amount you'll save on your water bill will make this worth every penny.

 One of the controller's best features is forecasting the local weather very precisely by using over 300,000 weather stations. This allows it to carefully monitor and automatically water your lawn without waste. When it rains, the Rachio 3 will not run unless more water is needed, and you can set customizable schedules based on your specific needs.

 You can control all of the above and more from the app on [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/rachio/id864325098) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206473/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rachio.iro&hl=en%5FCA&gl=US) devices, including setting up the schedules, turning the sprinklers on and off, and observing water usage. Even with an abundance of smart features, the Rachio 3's 16-zone design gives you more control to manage each section of your lawn perfectly.

 The installation process is easy if you follow the setup instructions---you can get it done within 30 minutes. Just remember to connect the device to your Wi-Fi so you can control it remotely. You may need to get a [Wi-Fi extender](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MS2VYHJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) if your router's range doesn't make it to the controller, but it's worth the extra investment given the Rachio 3's features.

 Once everything's good to go, you can use Alexa, Google Assistant, SmartThings, or HomeKit to control the Rachio easily.

Orbit

| Pros                            | Cons                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Less than $60                 | ✗ Only four zones (although an eight-zone model is available) |
| ✓ Versatile smartphone app      |                                                               |
| ✓ WeatherSense helps save water |                                                               |

 The [Orbit B-hyve 4-Zone Smart Indoor Sprinkler Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-B-hyve-57915-4-Station-Controller/dp/B07DJ2QTW9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) packs in a remarkable number of features considering its price tag, which clocks in at less than $60\. That makes it the cheapest product on this round-up by a large margin (excluding the [hose-based Orbit model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758NR8DJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) mentioned below), yet it still manages to put up a fight compared to the competition.

 One of the biggest drawbacks to this Orbit model is that you'll only have access to four customizable zones. Small yards will be fine with that limitation, but anyone with a large plot of land will probably want to spring for the [eight-zone model](https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-B-hyve-57915-4-Station-Controller/dp/B07DJ628XH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) (which is still less than $100). It's also only compatible with 110V setups---so be sure to double-check your system before making a purchase, although this shouldn't be an issue for most households.

 Beyond that, there's little else to complain about. This smart sprinkler controller works with apps on iOS, Android, and through a web app, can connect using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and there's no need for a monthly subscription. It even features WeatherSense technology to track your local forecast and optimize your watering schedule.

 Toss in the ability to manually override your schedule without deleting it entirely and built-in fault detection to help troubleshoot any issues, and it's shocking that the Orbit B-hyve 4-Zone Smart Indoor Sprinkler Controller carries such a low price tag.

 Need a hose-based controller for your home? You can install the [Orbit B-hyve Hose Faucet Timer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758NR8DJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to instantly turn your faucets into [EPA Certified](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-certifications) smart sprinkler controllers.

 These controllers are more expensive for a single zone as they provide exceptional functionality to your hose faucets. It's $67 for a [single controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758NR8DJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), $100 [for two,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LZ79BX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or $180 [for four](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099MBP395?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). They come in a weather-resistant cabinet that you can mount and lock up for security.

 Get as many controllers as you need as you'll have no problem using them in your yard. This is thanks to the B-hyve network meshing, which strengthens the signals of each controller to provide a stable connection to your Wi-Fi network.

 To install the controller, twist it in your outdoor faucets, then follow the setup instructions on the B-hyze app on [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/b-hyve/id1066451939) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206473/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbit.orbitsmarthome&hl=en%5FCA&gl=US) devices. You can then control each hose from the app whenever and however you'd like.

 For example, you can set manual timers for each controller or automatically create them using the built-in WeatherSense technology that tracks live weather feeds. Or, you precisely track your water usage by volume and time using the built-in flow meter.

 The Orbit B-hyve works with other B-hyve devices, which means you can also use them with a separate, dedicated [sprinkler controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D15HOTU?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), if you prefer.

HUNTER

| Pros                             | Cons                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Simple to use                  | ✗ Industrial, bland design |
| ✓ Creates detailed reports       | ✗ Expensive                |
| ✓ Detects broken pipes or valves |                            |

 If you prefer the simplicity of a touch-screen controller, then you'll want to take a closer look at the [HUNTER HC-600i Hydrawise](https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-HC-600i-Hydrawise-Sprinkler-Controller/dp/B01KI16XE2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). Its design is a bit bland and utilitarian, but the system is deliberately designed for easy installation and operation.

 The Hydrawise lets you do everything from check status to update settings from its touchscreen, giving you quick access to the system without needing to rely on a secondary device. Of course, there is a companion smartphone app---which lets you check in on the system remotely. You can also get detailed reports that cover everything from recent rainfall to when your next scheduled watering will begin.

 Another cool feature that Hydrawise brings to the table is leak monitoring. This makes it easy to determine if one of your valves is faulty or if a pipe has burst and needs to be repaired. All told, Hydrawise claims it can save you up to 50% on your water bills. And since you'll drop over $250 on the device, you'll be glad for the savings.

Eve

| Pros                                        | Cons                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Best integration for HomeKit,Siri enabled | ✗ Eve app not available for Android |

 Need the perfect controller for your Apple HomeKit ecosystem? Look no further with the $100 [Eve Aqua Smart Sprinkler Controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FBHCPPF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206473&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F794148%2Fbest-smart-sprinkler-controller%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 This controller integrates seamlessly with HomeKit, and you can quickly set it up within minutes. When installed, you can control the device with the voice assistant or Siri. Or, download the Eve app to access and remotely control all the Aqua Sprinker Controller's features---but it's only available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eve-for-homekit/id917695792). There's also an onboard button as a traditional method.

 The controller's Bluetooth compatible, and it also supports [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/BUILT-FOR-IOT/Smart-Home). However, you'll need a [HomePod Mini](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini) to act as a border router to connect to the Thread network. Luckily, you can use the controller without a bridge or gateway, as everything you need is in the box.

 There are plenty of convenient features, such as child-lock to prevent accidental changes to the controls. You can create schedules that'll run regardless of being connected to the internet. An auto shut-off feature prevents your sprinklers from over-watering, and you can track your water usage over time. Your privacy's also respected as there's no cloud service, registration required, or external tracking.
