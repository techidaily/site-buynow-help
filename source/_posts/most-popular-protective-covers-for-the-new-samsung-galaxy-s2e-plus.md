##  What to Look For in a Smartphone Case in 2024

 Hunting down a Samsung Galaxy S24+ case is no small feat, as there are hundreds of products to choose from. The first thing you'll want to consider is price, as it's possible to find cases for as little as $20, while some reach well over $70.

 Once you've set a price, you'll want to think about what type of case fits your lifestyle. Will you be bringing it with you on hikes or adventures? If so, consider something rugged and durable. Plan on keeping it in a purse or backpack? Then something smaller and with more personality could be a better option. You'll find that smartphone cases run the gamut from ultra-protective to ultra-slim—consider your needs (and how often you drop your phone) before making a purchase.

 The more protective a case, the larger it is. Keep this in mind, as you'll likely want to find a case that toes the line, offering good drop protection without weighing down your hand.

 Other considerations include personalization options and additional features, such as serving as a wallet or featuring a built-in kickstand for watching videos. Reliable brands such as OtterBox, Spigen, Smartish, and dbrand are always producing high-quality cases, though some lesser-known companies are also worth considering.

 Here's a look at the best Galaxy S24+ cases to help you with your search.

 These cases will only fit the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, and not the standard [Galaxy S24](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-streamers-financial-compliance-check/) or the [Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-cast-motorola-razr-40-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/). Make sure you have the right model selected before purchasing a case!

##  Best Galaxy S24+ Case Overall: [OtterBox Symmetry Series](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/trendy-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94542.html) 

![MixCollage-26-Jan-2024-11-59-AM-452](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mixcollage-26-jan-2024-11-59-am-452.jpg) 

The OtterBox Symmetry on a blue background.

| Pros                        | Cons          |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Slim but protective design  | No port cover |
| Several colors and patterns |               |
| Raised edges protect camera |               |

 The [OtterBox Symmetry Series for Galaxy S24+](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/trendy-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94542.html) is the ideal combination of protection and usability. Weighing less than 41 grams yet still rated for three times as many drops as [military standard](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/), it’s a well-rounded case that should surpass the requirements of most users.

 Composed of polycarbonate and synthetic rubber, the OtterBox Symmetry Series is durable yet grippy—ensuring it doesn’t slip out of your hand. It's also available in a wide range of colors and patterns, so you should be able to find something that matches your personality without any trouble.

 This is one of the thinnest cases offered by OtterBox, and because the Galaxy S24+ is a bit large itself, you probably don't want to add a lot of additional bulk. If you do need additional protection, consider checking out the [Commuter Series](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/slim-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94508.html), which offers many of the same features but isn't quite as streamlined.

Best Galaxy S24+ Case Overall

#####  Otterbox Symmetry Series for Galaxy S24+

The OtterBox Symmetry offers plenty of protection for your Galaxy S24+ without adding a ton of bulk. It's also reasonably priced and available in a variety of styles.

[See at OtterBox](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/trendy-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94542.html) 

##  Best Budget Galaxy S24+ Case: [Spigen Liquid Air](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4NVYBM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                       | Cons                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Textured design            | Limited color options |
| Button covers              | No port cover         |
| Supports wireless charging |                       |
| Great price                |                       |

 The [Spigen Liquid Air Galaxy S24+ Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4NVYBM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is about as inexpensive as cases get, yet it's still durable enough to protect your smartphone. It's only available in two colors ([black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4NLDBF?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [green](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4NVYBM?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)), but that's a minor inconvenience when compared to everything else it has to offer.

 While it's not very thick, the Spigen Liquid Air Galaxy S24+ uses air cushion technology to help protect your phone from drops. It also features a textured surface to improve your grip and give it a more luxurious look. You won't have much protection for your camera or screen (aside from very slightly raised edges), though button covers protect your volume controls on the side of the device.

 Rounding out the stat sheet is support for wireless charging, a form-fitted design that's easy to install, and reliability from a brand that's been around for nearly two decades.

Best Budget Galaxy S24+ Case

#####  Spigen Liquid Air for Galaxy S24

$18 $30 Save $12 

Cheap, durable, and surprisingly sleek, the Spigen Liquid Air is a great budget case for the Galaxy S24+. It lacks a port cover and there are limited color options, but it's a solid option for frugal shoppers.

[$18 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0CM4NVYBM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                          | Cons                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Innovative sliding design     | Not as much storage as other cases |
| Compact and slim              |                                    |
| Secures three cards plus cash |                                    |

 The [Smartish Wallet Case](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0CMRZHZZX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is unique among wallet cases, as it doesn't use the traditional storage flap seen on most other products. Instead, it uses an integrated slot to give it a streamlined profile.

 Accessing your cards and cash is simple with the Smartish case, as you can slide them out of their storage slot using your thumb. A spring-loaded design ensures they're kept snug inside the wallet when you don't need them. Some wallet cases might offer more storage (this one maxes out with three cards and some cash), but no doubt its thin profile and ease of access make it stand out from the pack.

 Several different patterns are available, but regardless of which you pick, your phone will be protected by a case that's rated for 50 drops at six feet. It also offers a bit of screen and camera protection with raised edges. Toss in a grippy texture to help prevent accidental drops, and you've got a well-rounded case that makes it easy to leave your wallet at home.

Best Galaxy S24+ Wallet Case

#####  Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 for Galaxy S24+

The Smartish Galaxy S24+ Wallet Case offers a slim profile yet enough space for three cards plus cash. Give it a look if you're tired of traditional, clunky wallet cases.

[$25 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0CMRZHZZX?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                              | Cons                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Incredible drop protection        | Bulky                 |
| Features antimicrobial properties | Limited color options |
| Raised edges protect camera       |                       |

 If you're concerned about protecting your phone at all costs, it's hard to go wrong with the [OtterBox Defender Series Pro](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94629.html). It's one of the most robust cases in the OtterBox lineup, offering a polycarbonate shell and rubber slipcover that do an excellent job of guarding your phone from scratches and falls.

 While most cases are rated to military standard, the Defender Series Pro is rated for five times as many drops as military standard. It also uses a port cover to protect your charging port, ensuring no dirt or debris gets wedged inside should you drop your phone. While most users won't find it necessary, the case includes a holster clip (though it doubles as a kickstand, which may come in handy for watching videos or gaming).

 Other notable features include antimicrobial properties to prevent the build-up of germs, raised edges to safeguard the screen and cameras, and a grippy texture to help you hold onto your device. Only a few colors are available, but aside from that drawback, there's little else to complain about with the Defender Series Pro.

Best Rugged Galaxy S24+ Case

#####  Otterbox Defender Series Pro for Galaxy S24+

The OtterBox Defender Series Pro protects your Galaxy S24+ from drops, scratches, and germs, thanks to an antimicrobial design. It's a bit pricey, but few cases protect as well as this.

[See at OtterBox](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001784/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/rugged-galaxy-s24plus-case-black/77-94629.html) 

##  Best Clear Galaxy S24+ Case: [Spigen Ultra Hybrid](https://www.spigen.com/collections/new-galaxy/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=41920567377967) 

![MixCollage-23-Jan-2024-01-16-PM-1904](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mixcollage-23-jan-2024-01-16-pm-1904.jpg)

| Pros                              | Cons                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Reasonable price                  | Limited camera protection |
| Strong polycarbonate construction | No port cover             |
| Blue resin for improved clarity   |                           |
| Slim profile                      |                           |

 Designed to show off the beauty of the Galaxy S23+, the [Spigen Ultra Hybrid](https://www.spigen.com/collections/new-galaxy/products/galaxy-s24-series-case-ultra-hybrid?variant=41920567377967) is a no-frills case. It's crafted to perfectly fit around the smartphone without any additional flairs, yet durable enough to protect it from scratches and minor drops.

 The big draw of the Ultra Hybrid is that it's infused with blue resin. This helps prevent it from yellowing over the years, ensuring it looks just as good as the day you bought it. The case is constructed with a blend of polycarbonate and thermoplastic polyurethane, which are ideal for protecting from scratches and small drops—though Spigen makes no claims of a military drop rating.

 This case also lacks port covers and offers limited protection for your camera, with edges that are only slightly raised. Still, clear cases aren't often known for their protective qualities, as they're meant to be slim and sleek and show off the hardware underneath. As far as that's concerned, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid is a great choice.

The Pitaka case perched on a rock with a sunset in the background.

| Pros                          | Cons                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Shockingly thin               | Expensive              |
| Weighs less than one ounce    | Limited design options |
| Built with non-slip materials |                        |
| Supports wireless charging    |                        |

 The [Pitaka Galaxy S24+ Case](https://www.amazon.com/PITAKA-Samsung-Galaxy-Compatible-MagSafe/dp/B0CQYNZF31?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001784&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-galaxy-s24-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might be the best-looking case on the market. Built with 1500D aramid fiber (commonly used in aerospace engineering), it's lightweight, durable, and incredibly easy on the eyes.

 Weighing in at less than an ounce and less than a tenth of an inch thick, the Pitaka case is small. It doesn't skimp on protection, however, as aramid fiber is great at preventing scratches and mitigating drop damage. The fiber also creates a unique pattern throughout the case that both looks striking and adds texture to improve your grip.

 While the case looks stylish and is shockingly thin, the Pitaka case doesn't come in many styles. And, as you'd expect for such a premium case, it's quite expensive compared to the competition. Few products are as slender and luxurious-looking, so it's worth a closer look if you're in the market for a thin case.

A variety of Samsung Vegan Leather cases on a colorful background.

| Pros                          | Cons                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Samsung reliability           | Limited drop protection |
| Premium, soft-touch materials | Limited color options   |
| Prevents scratches            |                         |

 Constructed from soft-touch materials for a premium feel, the [Samsung Vegan Leather Case for Galaxy S24+](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fvegan-leather-case-for-galaxy-s24-plus-black-gp-fps926hcabw%2F) gives your smartphone a sophisticated look. Only a couple of different colors are available, but that's one of the few drawbacks of this premium case.

 Designed by Samsung, you know the Vegan Leather Case is a perfect fit for the Samsung Galaxy S24+. The snug fit helps prevent scratches and scuffs, though (like most leather cases), its drop protection is limited. But with a soft inner lining and durable exterior, it'll protect your phone from keys, charging cables, or anything else placed next to it in your backpack or purse.

 Considering it’s a first-party product from Samsung, the Vegan Leather Case is reasonably priced. You may want to look elsewhere if you want a leather case with more flash, but if you want a sophisticated, understated look, this one checks all the right boxes.
