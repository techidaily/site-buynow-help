### Key Takeaways

* The Nintendo Switch offers a variety of fitness games for every level of workout intensity, including hits like _Ring Fit Adventure_ that are built around movement.
* The 3DS uses a built-in pedometer to encourage daily walking, earning rewards for more steps.
* _Wii Fit_ on the original Wii is arguably Nintendo's best fitness game, with personalized routines and easy progress tracking (plus it's easiy to find a cheap used console and Wii Balance Board).

 Setting a workout routine for yourself is often easier said than done. If you're looking for a simple way to start exercising, look no further than a current or older Nintendo console. Here's where to start.

##  Build Your Stamina With the Switch

[Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/)

 Few consoles offer as much variety in fitness and sports games as the Nintendo Switch. Whether you're looking for a quick workout or a full routine, the Switch has something for everyone.

 For a light workout, sports and dancing games like _Nintendo Switch Sports_ and _Just Dance 2024_ are the easiest way to keep yourself active for hours. Although they're not as strenuous or demanding as a traditional workout, these games are effective at burning calories. Between the massive song selection of the _Just Dance_ series and the abundance of sports available in _Nintendo Switch Sports_, the Switch makes it easy to spend hours working up a sweat (just be sure to [wear the Joy-Con's wrist strap](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-honor-magic5-ultimate-devices-by-drfone-android/) while you play).

_Pokémon_ _Let's Go Pikachu_ and _Let's Go Eevee_ can also help you stay active, albeit in a less direct way. Both titles allow you to import your Pokémon from [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pokémon-go/id1094591345) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004675/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&hl=en%5FUS) mobile hit _Pokémon GO_, meaning you can fill your Pokédex during outdoor walks rather than spending hours glued to a couch.

 Switch owners also have access to numerous fitness games that can be incorporated into a proper workout routine. Games like _Fitness Boxing_, _Knockout Home Fitness_, and _Let's Get Fit_ provide a mixture of upper-body and full-body exercises, along with the option to build workout regimens according to your preferences. These games also encourage you to maintain a consistent schedule by tracking your daily logins, calories burned, and other stats that illustrate your personal progress.

 However, few workout games are as effective as _Ring Fit Adventure_. Using the Switch's Ring-Con controller and Joy-Con leg strap, _Ring Fit Adventure_ leads you through [turn-based](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/navigating-new-innovations-through-toms-hardware-wisdom/) battles reminiscent of role-playing games like _Final Fantasy_ and _Dragon Quest_. But rather than selecting attacks from a menu, all your actions in _Ring Fit Adventure_ are performed through strength, cardio, and yoga exercises. Between fights, you'll run, jump, and shoot targets in a variety of linear obstacle courses. In addition to the campaign, _Ring Fit Adventure_ also features individual workouts and a rhythm game mode for shorter sessions.

_Ring Fit Adventure_ is much more intensive than most other fitness games on the Switch, but that's arguably its greatest strength. Exercises that involve squeezing the Ring-Con use the controller's resistance to help develop your upper body strength. Likewise, the leg strap allows _Ring Fit Adventure_ to track lower-body exercises, which are rarely seen in other Switch games.

 There are few fitness games on the Switch that are as varied and feature-rich as _Ring Fit Adventure_. The lengthy campaign will keep you hooked for hours, and the RPG-inspired leveling and upgrade systems provide plenty of reasons to replay the game on higher difficulties. With over 60 exercises that strengthen different parts of the body, _Ring Fit_ _Adventure_ delivers the most thorough workout experience on the Switch.

##  The 3DS Tracks Your Daily Step Count

 Even Nintendo handhelds can provide fulfilling workouts. The DS featured some fitness games like _Personal Trainer: Walking_, _Personal Fitness_, and _My Weight Loss Coach_, but these portable workout titles seemingly died out before the 3DS was released. However, you can still get fit with the 3DS by using its most underrated feature.

 You may have likely forgotten (or never even realized) that the 3DS contains a built-in pedometer. While in rest mode, the 3DS counts your steps and records your total step count for each day in the system's activity log. You can check the activity log to see your progress for each day, and compare the number of steps you took between multiple days, weeks, months, or years.

 After every 100 steps, the 3DS will reward you with a "Play Coin," which can be exchanged for prizes or currency in various games. Up to 10 Play Coins can be earned in a single day, encouraging 3DS owners to form a routine of logging at least 1,000 steps every day.

 Most games on the 3DS use the pedometer solely for exchanging Play Coins, but _Nintendogs + Cats_ is one of the rare exceptions. The virtual pet simulator provides the option to walk your dog (or cat) by using the pedometer. The amount of steps taken during these walks determines which prizes you receive the next time you return to the game. There is no upper limit on how many steps or prizes you can receive, which provides a way for 3DS owners to exercise for longer while still being rewarded.

 To be fair, the 3DS isn't as accurate or easy to carry as a traditional pedometer or [fitness tracker](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-health-advocacy-through-strategic-social-media-plays/). But for those looking for a reason to start jogging every day, the 3DS offers plenty of incentives.

##  The Best Workouts Are on the Wii

Nintendo

 Few consoles were as influential as the Wii, and its impact on fitness games cannot be overstated. Although the Switch is home to some of the [best games in the fitness genre](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-process-of-setting-up-your-logitech-webcam-for-video/), there's a reason people keep coming back to the Wii.

 Much of the Wii's success came from its impressive ability to turn exercise into a staple of game nights with friends and family. Like its Switch counterpart, the simple yet endlessly enjoyable design of _Wii Sports_ allows anyone to join in and start burning calories. While most of _Wii Sports_ boils down to just swinging the Wii remote, you'll likely find yourself running around in its tennis matches, performing full swings in golf and baseball, or flailing wildly while boxing.

_Wii Sports_ isn't the only game to transform light workouts into simple party games. _Just Dance_, _Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games_, _Wii Sports Resort_, _Dance Dance Revolution_, and many other Wii games all help you stay active without even feeling like you're exercising.

 The Wii is also worth owning for its massive selection of proper fitness games, with the most notable being _Wii Fit_. The game uses the Wii Balance Board for a variety of strength, yoga, and aerobics exercises. Some of these involve following a trainer through exercises of varying complexity, while others are imaginative minigames that test your balance and stamina.

_Wii Fit_ isn't a highly intensive game, especially when compared to _Ring Fit Adventure_, but it makes up for its limited difficulty with an abundance of useful fitness tools. Using the Balance Board as a scale, _Wii Fit_ can measure your body-mass index (BMI) and create a custom workout routine for you. With _Wii Fit_, it's easy to measure your progress over time and see the effects of the game's exercises. As an introduction to exercising, _Wii Fit_ is one of the best fitness games ever made (and it's fairly inexpensive to find a second-hand model, too).

 Not every fitness game on the Wii is as thorough and feature-rich as _Wii Fit_, but the console still boasts an impressive variety of workout programs and exercises. Whether it's boxing with _Gold's Gym: Cardio Workout_ (the precursor to the Switch's _Fitness Boxing_), dancing alongside _Zumba: Fitness Core_, or strength training with _My Fitness Coach_, you're likely to find the right workout for you on the Wii.

##  Fitness Has Always Been Part of Nintendo's DNA

 Even before the Wii sparked a fitness craze within the gaming industry, Nintendo had been combining fitness and gaming since the '80s.

 Nintendo previously published various toys and peripherals that aimed to make fitness seem fun. One of the first fitness-oriented releases was the Power Pad, a floor mat created for Bandai's _Family Fun Fitness_ series on the NES. The Power Pad featured pressure-sensitive buttons and supported sports games such as _World Class Track Meet_ (originally released as _Stadium Events_) and _Super Team Games_.

 Nintendo continued to publish fitness products in the late '90s, starting with _Pokémon Pikachu_—a pedometer that also functions as a virtual pet. By logging steps with the _Pokémon Pikachu_, you can earn currency to buy presents and raise your friendship with your pet Pikachu. Nintendo later released a second generation of the _Pokémon Pikachu_ as well as the Pokéwalker—a similar pedometer/virtual pet that came bundled with _Pokémon HeartGold_ and _SoulSilver_.

 Yet even with their many advancements and innovations over the years, Nintendo's fitness games have never been designed to replace traditional workouts. _Ring Fit Adventure_ may burn some calories, but don't count on getting a six-pack just by playing it. Instead, these games ease you into a proper workout routine through light exercises presented in creative and entertaining ways, making them perfect for both beginners and experienced gym-goers.

 Whether you're struggling to commit to a workout regimen due to a lack of time or motivation, or you just want a healthy way to pass the time, Nintendo's fitness games are the best way to start incorporating exercise into your daily routine.
