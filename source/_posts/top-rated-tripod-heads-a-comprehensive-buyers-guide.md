##  Why Are Tripod Heads Important?

 If you're just starting out and [building your kit](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mastering-pinterest-content-top-5-free-download-apps/), you may wonder whether you should bother with a tripod head. Some [tripods](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-oppo-find-x6-pro-by-drfone-android/) come packaged with one, while others are designed to work with various options depending on the intended use. Do you really need a tripod?

 To get the most out of your tripod, you'll want to invest in a good head to pair it with. A well-engineered tripod head allows a photographer or videographer to get the angles they need and lock the camera securely in place without hand-holding.

 You don't have to spend over a grand on one, but it's worth it to put a little money down, especially if you know you'll be using a tripod often. Landscape photographers, wildlife shooters, and people that do a lot of night photography can all benefit from a sturdy tripod head.

 Like any other piece of kit, a tripod head is a tool. Which one you need comes down to what and how you shoot. If you're shooting in the wild regularly, you'll want something sturdy to handle a rugged environment and a heavy camera setup. Videographers might want to check out fluid heads with their smooth pan and tilt action for buttery, jerk-free camera movement.

 Keep your existing gear in mind, too. What camera setup do you have? Most tripod heads will list their weight capacity on the product page, so know roughly what your rig weighs and whether the tripod head you're considering will be able to support it.

 Make sure the head you want works with [your tripod](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-oppo-find-x6-pro-by-drfone-android/), and that your tripod is sturdy---there's no point in pairing an expensive, well-designed head with a cheap and flimsy base if the tripod legs can't support your gear. If you know you'll be switching back and forth between a tripod and handheld shooting often, get a head with a quick-release plate.

 There are multiple types of tripod heads, from geared to ball heads to fluid heads. There's usually overlap in their capabilities that allows for multiple shooting types. Still, if you do one genre of photography more than another, it makes sense to buy a tripod head made for that photography, with other uses being a secondary bonus.

 Geared tripod heads, for example, have multiple knobs that let you dial in the angle of your camera with a fine degree of control---something very advantageous in a studio setting. A ball head that lets you swivel your camera without making adjustments, however, might be better for the wildlife photographer.

 Build quality and weight are also important. A tripod head is a small piece of kit, but it can add up when you pair a heavy tripod head with a bunch of other gear you must haul around all day. Look for something light, strong, and the right size for your needs.

 Now that we've gone over the relevance and potential uses of a good tripod head, let's look at some of the best ones you can buy.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| â Solid build quality                              | â Not for fast-paced shooting |
| â Three gears allow for fine adjustment            |                               |
| â Includes an Arca-Swiss quick release plate mount |                               |

 The [Benro GD3WH](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C326563?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)tripod head is a solid entry from a trusted manufacturer that allows for very fine adjustments via three geared knobs. While the Benro may be slightly cheaper than other leading brands---but not inexpensive, as it's still over $200---it maintains a similar level of quality.

 For example, an included Arca-Swiss mount means compatibility with a wide range of quick-release plates for those that like to switch between tripod and handheld shooting. This is perfect if you need to get just the right angle on a shot and holding the camera is the easiest way to do it.

 Benro's tripod head has a sturdy magnesium alloy build---lightweight but tough---and the included bubble-level helps line up those shots that need to be straight.

 While the GD3WH is not what you'd want for fast-paced shooting, this tripod head is great for [studio](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/rethinking-content-strategy-with-instagrams-new-order/) and architectural photography.

 Manfrotto's [502HD](https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-502-Video-Head-MVH502AH/dp/B006TZE0UQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-built, relatively affordable fluid tripod head from a respected name in tripods and photo accessories. Engineered to adjust very smoothly, it can handle a weight capacity of just over 15 lbs, meaning this tripod head can hold cinema setups on the heavier side.

 This head is also built with counterbalances to help with uneven weight, and [users praise](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUOQM77OLB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) the built-in Fluid Drag System for its buttery pans. This is a great option for cinematographers and even still photographers looking to step up to more serious gear on a budget.

 There is one caveat, however---some users [said](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZKDL7741?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) the head needed adjustment before it moved as fluidly as it should, as it sometimes ships tightened up, so keep that in mind when you take this one out of the box.

Best Tripod Ball Head

#####  3 Legged Thing AirHed Pro Tripod Head

The 3 Legged Thing AirHead Pro Ball Head is a lightweight yet super strong magnesium alloy ball head with a load capacity of 88lbs, strong enough to carry your kit and light enough to travel with. 

[$153 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Legged-Thing-AirHed-Lever-Ballhead/dp/B0821KJG1B/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [See at B&H Photo Video](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1522171-REG/3%5Flegged%5Fthing%5Fahprogrey%5Fairhed%5Fpro%5Fball%5Fhead.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU205252)

| Pros                        | Cons                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| â Very affordable           | â Can't hold heavier setups                      |
| â Compact design            | â Not as many features as more expensive options |
| â Very capable for its size |                                                  |

 As its name implies, the [SmallRig Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0833XYY5Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205252&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F818111%2Fbest-tripod-head%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid choice for the photographer or videographer traveling light or trying to build a compact kit. This ball tripod head offers much of the same compatibility and capabilities as its larger and pricer counterparts in a smaller package.

 The SmallRig Mini can be used by photographers and videographers alike, holding [mirrorless](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/latest-graphics-framework-refresh-enhanced-laptops-featuring-intel-core-ultra-and-amd-ryzen-series/)and compact cinema cameras with a larger lens attached. 360-degree rotation allows for cool panoramic shots when filming b-roll or other video footage.

 Its smaller size means lower weight capacity, though, so keep that in mind---you won't be able to attach a heavy wildlife rig to this tripod head.

Its multiple knobs allow for fine adjustment similar to a [geared tripod head](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ensuring-transparency-in-video-creator-incomes/), for example, and the TH3 incorporates friction dampening measures to help keep the camera steadier even with heavier gear attached. It also includes multiple bubble levels to ensure your shot is lined up correctly.

 The TH3 is an all-rounder tripod head, able to be used adequately for stills or video. It's not the top of the line but is perfect for beginners and people on a budget who want to try out more advanced shots.
