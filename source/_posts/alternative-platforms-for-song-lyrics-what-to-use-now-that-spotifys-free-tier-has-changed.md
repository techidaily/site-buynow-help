 Spotify recently removed lyrics from its basic free plan—a feature that had been available for two years. If you're frustrated about that, don’t worry! There are plenty of other music streaming services out there that still let you sing along. Let's dive into the best free music streaming services that still offer lyrics support.

##  Why Lyrics Are Important For A Streaming Music Service

 There are countless times I've tried singing along to music without the right lyrics. It feels terrible. Lyrics allow us to connect deeply with the music, understand the artist’s message, and belt out those high notes with confidence. They turn casual listening into a full-on karaoke session, whether you're alone or with friends.

 Lyrics aren’t just fun; they’re essential for non-native speakers and those with hearing impairments. They make music more inclusive, ensuring everyone can enjoy and understand the words behind the beats. It’s like having a translator and a storyteller wrapped into one.

 With Spotify paywalling lyrics, we have to find something else to scratch that karaoke itch. These alternatives are worth it, offering lyrics at their free tier.

###  YouTube Music

[YouTube Music](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-overloaded-tiktok-saves-a-guide-to-editing-and-streamlining/) is a fantastic alternative. It offers an extensive library of music videos, live performances, and user-generated content. You can search for songs by lyrics, making it super easy to find and sing along to your favorites.

 Despite the ads on the free tier, YouTube Music still supports lyrics for many tracks. Not all songs have lyrics, but the availability is pretty good. Plus, you can access it on the web, iOS, and Android platforms, so it’s pretty flexible. There are a lot of lyric music videos on the platform as well for a complete karaoke experience.

###  Deezer

 Next up is Deezer, a service that offers lyrics for many tracks in its vast library. With personalized playlists and SongCatcher to identify songs, Deezer is a solid choice for music lovers.

 The free tier supports lyrics but is limited to shuffle mode and comes with ads. However, Deezer’s intuitive interface and availability on web, iOS, Android, and more make it a convenient option for those looking to switch from Spotify.

###  Pandora

 Before Spotify came about, I used [Pandora](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-shrouded-screen-images-techniques-for-redacting-info/). Pandora offers personalized radio stations and access to lyrics, making it a great alternative. The service also includes Pandora Stories, which add more context to your favorite tracks.

 The free tier has some limitations, like fewer skips and ads, but it still provides lyrics support. Pandora is available on web, iOS, and Android, ensuring you can listen and sing along wherever you are.

##  What's the Best Alternative to Spotify?

 There's always some leeway when it comes to determining the best of anything. Everyone has their preferences, and each of the alternatives has pros and cons to their free tier.

 You should look at what the alternatives have in terms of coverage and availability. Make sure the service you pick works seamlessly across all your devices. Whether you’re using a smartphone, tablet, or web browser, compatibility is key to a smooth listening experience. Some services offer seamless switching, allowing users to go between a web interface and mobile without interruption.

 If you change, the biggest thing to get used to will be the user interface. Look for a service with easy navigation and a clean layout. A great interface will make discovering new music and managing playlists a joy rather than a chore.

 Spotify's choice to shut free users out of lyrics is a bad deal. Luckily, you're not stuck being forced to pay for the service. There are more than a handful of alternatives that still offer lyrics as part of their free tier. While Spotify is the most popular service, it's far from the only one you can use. Maybe it's time to show them that cutting lyrics from the free tier was a terrible mistake.
