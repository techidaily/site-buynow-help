##  Shopping For A MagSafe Battery Pack in 2023

 Apple's inclusion of MagSafe technology on the iPhone has enabled a vast ecosystem of [cases](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and [accessories](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/), some of which are more helpful than others. One common type of accessory is a MagSafe battery pack, which can attach to your iPhone without needing an adhesive and charge your device wirelessly while you're out and about.

 Over the years, the market has somewhat matured, and a bevy of different options have sprouted. They're each designed for different uses and tastes, so it's important to keep in mind exactly what you're looking for.

 Size is perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind. If you want something that can charge your iPhone from zero to 100 percent more than once, you'll want to shop for packs that are 5,000[mAh](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-bypass-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-frp-by-drfone-android/) or more. However, this means you'll be looking at battery packs that will add quite a bit of thickness to your device.

 If you want something discrete that won't add a lot of thickness and weight, you'll need to look at smaller solutions that will limit the number of times you can recharge your phone on the go (think anything less than 4,000-5,000mAh). But if you don't mind extra chunkiness, you can pretty much go as big as you want to.

 Some MagSafe battery packs also offer neat tricks like the ability to charge two devices (one via MagSafe, one over a wire). Some come with bonus accessories like stands, so you have somewhere to dock your iPhone and battery pack at the end of the day. There are many different battery packs nowadays to pick from, all of which are suited for different people.

 That being said, almost every battery pack is the same in terms of functionality. They all connect to the back of your iPhone, almost all offer 5W charging speeds, and you'll only ever find either a single USB-C or Lightning port for charging the packs themselves. What matters in your hunt is finding the right size power pack with the right amount of features and a good price.

 We're helping you search for a MagSafe battery pack with this roundup of some of the best on the market. Keep reading to check out our selections.

Anker

| Pros                               | Cons                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| High-capacity 10000mAh             | Fairly expensive           |
| Quality materials and construction | Relatively heavy and bulky |
| Built-in kickstand                 |                            |
| Great safety features              |                            |

 The [Anker 633 MagGo Wireless Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Portable/dp/B09NRG4GK3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) makes it to the top spot on this list due to its excellent combination of features overall. It might be bested on things like size, charging speed, or price when looked at individually. When considered as a complete package, though, this MagSafe battery pack is pretty hard to beat.

 Those who need as much power in their MagSafe battery pack as possible will love the Anker 633\. It boasts a huge 10,000mAh battery, enough to fully charge some iPhones up to four times. Even the large power cells in the latest iPhone 14 and 15 models can be charged twice.

 While you'll be limited to 5W wireless charging, Anker throws in a couple of USB ports (one [USB-C](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/), one USB-A) that can supply 20W fast charging to your iPhone using a supported cable. An LED light lets you know how much juice is left, and there's a kickstand on the back to prop up your device while recharging.

 Anker is a well-respected brand known for producing good-quality gadgets and accessories. That's always reassuring when considering a battery pack, where reliable safety features are essential. And that's exactly what you get here, with temperature control, foreign object detection, and radiation shielding, to name just a few.

 Admittedly, the battery capacity and strong magnet make this a chunky power bank, and you'll need to be okay with adding a bit of heft to your iPhone. But if you can live with that, you can't go wrong with this portable power option from Anker.

 If you're shopping on a budget, we recommend checking out Belkin's [Wireless Portable Charger Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Compatible/dp/B08ZCVXRKP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). With a slim design and a comparatively low price, this MagSafe battery bank has a lot of smart features for the price.

 Its 2,500mAh cell can provide your iPhone with just under a full charge for most users, and it features an LED indicator light, so you can check to see how much more power is left. A [USB-C](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/) port sits on the bottom for charging the power bank, and you can simultaneously charge your iPhone when the accessory is connected.

 If you have a higher-end Pro Max model, you won't be able to fully recharge your phone with this power bank. But for quick top-ups on the go, this is a really solid option.

Best Budget MagSafe Battery Pack

#####  Belkin Wireless Portable Charger Power Bank

$37 $50 Save $13 

Belkin's 2,500mAh MagSafe battery pack is an excellent choice if you're on a budget.

[$37 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Compatible/dp/B08ZCVXRKP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)

![ESR 10000mAh battery pack](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/esr-batterypack.png) 

ESR

| Pros                                    | Cons                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 10,000mAh battery capacity              | Not as ergonomic as it could be |
| Fast 20W wired charging built-in        |                                 |
| Reasonably priced                       |                                 |
| Dual-charging and pass-through charging |                                 |

 If you regularly spend time away from a power outlet or do lots of battery-intensive activities like recording video on your iPhone, a large-capacity battery pack is likely a must-have. Enter the [ESR 10000mAh Portable Charger](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-MagSafe-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B0B6W7BKHT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), a MagSafe battery pack that should be more than powerful enough for almost any situation.

 It has enough juice to fully charge the latest iPhones around one and a half times, and some older models twice. If you feel like sharing, it can also recharge a second phone via a cable while it charges the device to which it is attached wirelessly. If you find yourself near a power outlet, pass-through lets you simultaneously recharge the phone and battery pack.

 Charging speed will depend on how the battery pack is used. It will wirelessly charge a single phone at 7.5W or 20W via the cable. When charging two devices at once, wireless charging drops to 5W and wired charging to 10W.

 The ESR battery pack definitely isn't slim, but less chunky than many MagSafe battery packs of similar capacity, and the 1,000g magnet is more than enough to hold it firmly in place. The outer face is slightly curved to make it more comfortable to hold, but not as much as it could have been. It isn't as ergonomically shaped as the official Apple MagSafe battery, for example.

 There are MagSafe battery packs available with 15,000 or 20,000mAh capacity, but they are generally brick-like and expensive. The ESR 10000 is the perfect compromise in terms of size, weight, battery capacity, and price, making it easy to recommend for anyone who needs to ensure their Apple phone lasts all day and beyond.

At 0.5 inches, it's one of the thinnest packs you can find on the market. The best part is its inclusion of a 5,000mAh battery, which is more than enough to charge your iPhone fully after it dies. There's also an LED light for checking the power tank.

 It has a silicon design available in five colors: [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Ultra-Thin/dp/B0986MW7NW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Ultra-Thin/dp/B09JVR1P4W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Baby Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Ultra-Thin/dp/B09Q5YZ4BY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Purple](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Ultra-Thin/dp/B09T6YTPJQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [White](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Ultra-Thin/dp/B09MJZCKT1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). A USB-C port sits on the bottom for charging the battery pack itself, and it can be used to charge your iPhone over a wire at 15W if you need something faster than 5W wireless charging.

 It's relatively affordable, although it's a little bland in the feature department since there aren't any. It's a very straightforward MagSafe battery pack, and if that's all you need, you'll dig it.

Best Compact/Thin MagSafe Battery Pack

If you need a MagSafe battery pack that's nice and compact, Benks has what you need.

| 5,000mAh battery                  | Only way to recharge the battery pack is through the stand |
| Premium stand                     | Pricey                                                     |
| Bonus 5W Qi wireless charging pad |                                                            |

[Anker's 633 MagGo 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B385PDW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is perhaps one of the most elaborate MagSafe battery packs you can get, but if you want one that can stand up, this is the one to get.

 Not only does it come with a 5,000mAh battery pack, but it also ships with a docking station where you can slide the power pack in to charge it. It comes with a 25W charger for the stand itself, which also supplies energy for a bonus Qi wireless charging pad at its foot, providing a perfect place to recharge accessories like AirPods.

 It's available in three colors: [Dolomite White](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B385PDW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Interstellar Gray](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B38GW7G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Misty Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B39BRVS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F820620%2Fbest-magsafe-battery-pack%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The power pack itself is pretty slim, so it shouldn't get in the way much, and there's an LED indicator light to check charge levels.

 In terms of downsides, there's only one way to charge the power pack—the stand itself. There's no external USB-C or Lightning port, which means you can only charge your iPhone through MagSafe. It's also pretty pricey, but if you want the best stand, this one is it.

### What is MagSafe?

[MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) is a set of magnets built into the iPhone (and some other Apple products) that allow you to charge your device wirelessly. There have also been several [MagSafe accessories](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/) that have been released, making MagSafe more versatile.

### Which iPhones have MagSafe?

 All iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and iPhone 14 models have MagSafe built in. The iPhone SE does not have MagSafe charging, is if that is important to you, you'll want to avoid the budget iPhone model.

### Do you need a MagSafe case to use MagSafe?

 You do not. MagSafe is built into the iPhone itself, so you do not need a MagSafe case to use the feature. However, MagSafe cases ensure that the magnets still work properly even through the case; if you plan on using a case with your iPhone and want to use MagSafe, you'll want to look for a MagSafe-compatible case.

### Is MagSafe bad for your battery?

 No, MagSafe does not affect your iPhone's battery or performance.
