## 1 _Puyo Puyo Tetris 2_ 

 An all-time favorite of mine, _Puyo Puyo Tetris 2_ is the adorably fun mashup of Sega's _Puyo Puyo_ puzzler series and the all-time classic _Tetris._ Players can face off against up to three friends to outlast the rest in "swap battles" which switch between both games on the fly mid-match, or simply play each game separately.

 While _Tetris_ tasks players with stacking various shaped blocks to create "lines" that earn points, _Puyo Puyo_ is a gravity-based match-four puzzle game. The game is available for nearly every platform under the sun and even has a free demo that effectively lets you play the main game mode infinitely at no cost, so the barrier for entry is fairly minimal.

## 2 _Duck Game_ 

 A fittingly funny product of Adult Swim Games, _Duck Game_ puts you and your friends in control of some cartoon ducks in various 2D arenas with a multitude of weapons and tasks you with just one thing: survive. The last player standing earns a point and the first to reach a set number of points wins the game.

 On top of weapons like machine guns, rocket launchers, and even melee options, there is a plethora of power-ups and modifiers you can turn on or off to enhance the game even more. _Duck Game_ is available on the PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch and PC.

## 3 _Rocket League_ 

 Affectionately called "soccer with cars" by many, _Rocket League_ is, well, pretty much exactly that. The game pits players against each other in rocket-powered cars to score goals. Players can face off against each other in split-screen matches, or team up against others online.

 Featuring robust customization options for your in-game vehicles and a slew of game modes and modifiers, there is no shortage of things to unlock and work towards. The game went free to play a few years back and is available on all current platforms making it a fun, free way to spend an afternoon with some friends.

## 4 _Brawlhalla_ 

 Despite its reputation as a free alternative to _Super Smash Bros.,_ _Brawlhalla_ has a lot of its own unique charms compared to Nintendo's flagship fighter. It takes on the same 2D level design and similar mechanics where damage builds over time but retains its own identity with slower-paced gameplay and mostly original characters.

 While the game is free to play, it does have a limited roster of free characters that cycle out regularly, with the rest available for permanent unlock via [microtransactions](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-list-7-cost-free-video-tags-extractors-on-youtube/). With franchises like the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ and _Assassin's Creed_ making their way into the roster, it may be worth a punt if you're a fan of fighting games.

## 5 _Portal 2_ 

 One of the most iconic games of all time and certainly one of the best puzzle-platformers out there, _Portal 2_ tasks players with navigating a series of test chambers using their portal gun that allows them to move from one point to another instantaneously. While the single-player campaign is already one of the greatest of all time, the game also features a robust two-player co-op campaign where players can solve increasingly difficult rooms together.

 Players control a pair of charming little robots as they work their way through the campaign's numerous stages, working together to overcome each challenge in uniquely inventive ways. The game is available on the PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One and Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC and Mac.

## 6 _Overcooked!_ 

 A fun twist on the restaurant sim genre, _Overcooked!_ is a duology of fast-paced co-op cooking games where players must manage resources and work together to fill orders on time. The levels get increasingly more chaotic as the game progresses and players will have to work together to find the most efficient ways to split up their tasks and keep the food moving.

 It doesn't matter which game you choose to pick up, both offer a similar amount of content, though the sequel also offers online multiplayer for those who might want it. Available on the PS4/5, Xbox One and Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch, _Overcooked!_ serves up fast-paced fun for everyone.

## 7 _Minecraft: Bedrock Edition_ 

 One of the less obvious features of the Bedrock version of _Minecraft_ is that it is the only one to support local multiplayer via split-screen on console versions. Up to four players can build, craft, and survive together in procedurally generated worlds or build the structures of their dreams in creative mode all from the same room.

 The game also supports cross-platform online multiplayer across the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch versions of the game, and online players can join your split-screen sessions seamlessly. _Minecraft: Bedrock Edition_ is available on the PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.

## 8 _Super Mario Party_ 

 The long-running _Super Mario Party_ franchise is Nintendo's flagship board game simulator featuring fan-favorite characters from the Mario universe. The latest entry, _Super Mario Party_ for the Nintendo Switch, is a more streamlined take on the series that pits players against each other in turn-based competitions mixed in with fun, short-form minigames.

 While the newest entry lacks the same amount of content as older titles, it does bring backstages and mini-games from previous titles and offers hours of fun between you and your friends. Choose between your favorite Mario characters and battle it out to get the most stars by the end of the last turn to take home the victory.

## 9 _Baldur's Gate 3_ 

 2023's Game of the Year winner, _Baldur's Gate 3_ already offers hundreds of hours of RPG content, but with another player, the possibilities are even broader. Players can party up with a friend and make their own characters to venture through the game's open world together.

 Considering how large and robust the game already is, playing _Baldur's Gate 3_ with a friend could add a whole new layer of strategy and decision-making as you work together to beat bosses and make story decisions. The game is available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC; the Series S version does not feature split-screen co-op, however.

## 10 _Call of Duty_ 

 Most of the _Call of Duty_ titles feature split-screen gameplay across most game modes, except Warzone in _Modern Warfare III._ Whether you're looking for co-op action with the zombies mode or you want to battle it out in several competitive modes, you and some friends can do worse than the flagship shooter franchise on consoles.

 You can even team up with friends locally for multiplayer matches, letting you experience most of the content in the same room with almost no limits. Of course, not every _Call of Duty_ game supports this, so make sure whichever you choose supports the game modes you want to play before you buy. The games are available pretty much everywhere including PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
