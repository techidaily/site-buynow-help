## Price Hikes Coming for Spotify's Solo, Pair & Family Plans Across America

Once again, Spotify is jacking up its prices in the United States. Premium subscriptions are now $11.99, up from $10.99, while Duo and Family pricing has increased by $2 and $3, respectively. Current subscribers will begin experiencing these new prices in July.

 We heard rumors of this price increase [a few months ago](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-disconnecting-from-your-old-linkedin-account/). At that time, we assumed that Spotify was hoping to recoup costs from its new [audiobook library](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-engage-and-inspire-viewers-animated-subscribers-in-filmora-explained/). Spotify has not confirmed our suspicion and simply states that it will "continue to invest in and innovate on our product features."

* **Spotify Premium**: $11.99 (Up from $10.99)
* **Premium Duo**: $16.99 (Up from $14.99)
* **Premium Family**: $19.99 (Up from $16.99)
* **Premium Student**: $5.99 (Unchanged)

 Historically, Spotify has avoided price hikes. The company's Premium plan retained its original $9.99 price tag from 2011 to 2023\. And when the first price hike arrived in 2023, most people could tolerate itâ€”a jump from $9.99 to $10.99 wasn't too unreasonable (and fell way short of the rate of inflation).

 Today's price hike is equally "small," clocking in at just $1 extra for Premium individual subscribers. But it's far more worrying than last year's price hike, as it indicates that Spotify may continue charging customers more and more money. I'd like to point out that July 2024 is the anniversary of last year's price hike. While I'm a big fan of consistency, the idea that this could become an annual affair is nauseating. Other streaming services, including [Peacock](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-precision-in-performance-utilizing-social-blade-for-youtube-data/), have pulled similar "anniversary" price hikes this year, so it may be an industry trend.

 Note that Apple Music's current pricing is identical to Spotify's old pricing. If you want a music streaming subscription that costs $10.99 a month (or a family plan that's just $16.99), go check out [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/#plans). (Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that Apple will maintain its pricing.)

 Spotify's updated pricing is already in effect for new subscribers. Existing customers will begin to feel the pain in July, which is just a month away at the time of writing. This price hike only applies to the United States, though Spotify adjusted its pricing in other regions (such as [the UK](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/spotify-subscription-price-uk-cost-increase-may-b1150423.html)) in the first months of 2024.
