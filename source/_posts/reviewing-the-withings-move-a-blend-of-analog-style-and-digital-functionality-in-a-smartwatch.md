## Nanotechnology Enables the Development of Dental Materials with Improved Mechanical Properties and Antibacterial Activity at a Nanoscale Level

The best smartwatches balance beauty and practicality, so you can proudly wear them whether working out or at the office.

 I’ve enjoyed using the Apple Watch Series 9 the most out of the many smartwatches I’ve tried. It’s stylish and has plenty of genuinely useful features.

 For Android users, my favorite is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, which has an array of health tools and a pleasing design.

**TL;DR:** Highly customizable for any situation, simple to use, and regularly updated, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the one to beat.

### Why We Recommend This

 I’ve been using Apple Watches since they first launched in 2015\. Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.

 While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.

 It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.

 If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.

 Pros

* Good looking always-on display
* Customizable watch straps and watch faces
* Extensive app support

 Cons

* Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.
* Fitness tracking could be more refined
* iPhone-only

 Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.

 There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.

 Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.

 It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.

 Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.

* **Who else recommends it?** Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.
* **What do buyers think?** The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.

**TL;DR:** Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.

### Why We Recommend This

 The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.

 One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  

 Pros

* Looks good
* Samsung Health features are insightful
* Bright and vibrant screen

 Cons

* Android-only
* Non Samsung users need to install extra apps

 Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.

 What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.

 It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.

 Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.

 It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.

* **Who else recommends it?** TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6\.
* **What do buyers think?** The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.

**TL;DR:** More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.

### Why We Recommend This

 A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.

 It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.

 Pros

* Great battery life
* Works with both iOS and Android
* Body battery and stress tracking is useful

 Cons

* Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches
* Could be more stylish

 I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.

 It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.

 Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.

 It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.

 It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.

 Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  

* **Who else recommends it?** PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.
* **What do buyers think?** The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars. Its average rating is 4.4 out of 5.

## How We Test

 I reviewed each smartwatch based on the following factors:

* Looks
* Setup
* Ease of daily use
* Battery life
* Device support

 I purchased the Apple Watch Series 9 and Garmin Vivoactive 5, while I borrowed the Google Pixel Watch 2 from a friend. The Amazfit Balance, and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 were loaned to me by the respective companies.

 I used all the devices for several weeks, with some smartwatches used for months. I wore them daily while working, exercising, relaxing, and asleep.

## What to Look For

 Buying a smartwatch involves finding the right balance between looks and practicality. Consider where you plan on wearing it, such as in the office or when walking, and plan accordingly.

 Also, think about the battery life you need and what phone you need it to be compatible with. Depending on your intentions, don’t forget to consider sleep or exercise tracking.

## Other Smartwatches We Reviewed

 The[Google Pixel Watch 2](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Best-Fitbit/dp/B0CCQ7DNQL?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7C) is potentially the most beautiful smartwatch, so it can’t cope with a rugged lifestyle. It is a bit limited at times and pricey, which means it isn’t the best around, but it’s certainly eye-catching.

 The[Amazfit Balance](https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7C) feels cheap on your wrist and unrefined in places. However, for a budget smartwatch, it’s a good entry point.
