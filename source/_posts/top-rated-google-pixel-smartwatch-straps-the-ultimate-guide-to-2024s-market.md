##  What to Look for in a Google Pixel Watch Band in 2024

 Google's first in-house smartwatch, the [Pixel Watch](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Smartwatch-Champagne/dp/B0BDSDCFN4?th=1&tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), was unveiled in 2022 as a complimentary device to your [Google Pixel phone](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7-5G-Android-Phone/dp/B0BCQVRH38?th=1&tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). Since then, many folks have added the smartwatch to their everyday carry, taking advantage of its minimalist design, seamless integration with Fitbit health tracking tools, and handy widget system for glancing at information on the go.

 Just like an [Apple Watch](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-huawei-nova-y71-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) or [Samsung Galaxy Watch](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), it's easy to customize the look and feel of your Pixel Watch with a new band. Google's locking system for bands is completely proprietary, so when you're shopping for a new band, you'll need to make sure it's compatible with the Pixel Watch.

 In other words, you can't search for "20 mm watch bands" and expect them to work; they'll need the circular lugs that can be secured to the Pixel Watch's outer frame. Luckily, the Pixel Watch is only offered in one size, so any band that advertises Pixel Watch compatibility should work fine.

 When searching for the perfect band, you'll need to ask yourself a few questions. Where will you be wearing your Pixel Watch? Does it need to be made of a certain material? Are you trying to match a specific color scheme? Need it to look nice enough for the office while casual enough for a night on the town?

 Asking these questions will ensure that you get the best Pixel Watch band (or bands!) for your needs.

 We'd also like to point out that not every Pixel Watch band is created the same. Some have stronger lugs that can latch onto the Pixel Watch more securely, while others use cheaper materials and cut-outs that can lead to looser connections and a generally poorer experience.

 Our picks below are all high-quality bands, some made by Google itself, so you can rest easy knowing you'll be choosing from the best Google Pixel Watch bands currently available.

| Pros                               | Cons           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| â Soft, flexible material          | â A bit pricey |
| â Completely water and sweat proof |                |
| â Available in multiple colors     |                |

 The [Google Pixel Watch Active Band](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Active-Band/dp/B0BDT9DVF4?tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is not only the perfect everyday strap for your Pixel Watch, but also the band we recommend for working out.

 Its soft [fluoroelastomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroelastomer) material, coupled with a soft-touch coating, is flexible and waterproof. The latching system offers excellent security---so you don't have to worry about the watch falling off---and the lugs are made of stainless steel for a premium finish.

 Admittedly, this band is sort of expensive. At $50, it's pretty tempting to go shopping for an alternative silicone band. However, if you want the very best band to complement your active lifestyle, we highly suggest paying a bit more for premium Google quality.

 If you plan on swimming with your Pixel Watch, Caseology's [Nano Pop Band](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Silicone-Designed-Google-Pixel/dp/B0B2VF5QDL?tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is worth picking up. The band adds extra protection to your watch with an integrated, military-grade protective case, compatible with screen protectors and made entirely of waterproof material.

 The band uses a more traditional latch for increased security on your wrist while in the water, and all controls, from the crown to the side button, are easily accessible.

 Of course, the band will add a bit of bulk to your Pixel Watch with its integrated case, and the two color options---[Prune Charcoal](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Silicone-Designed-Google-Pixel/dp/B0B2VF5QDL?tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Blueberry Navy](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Silicone-Designed-Google-Pixel/dp/B0B2VVN2RH?th=1&tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)\---might not be for everyone.

| â Sweat resistant                    |                         |

 Stretch bands are great for comfort and style, and the best one you can get is Google's [Pixel Watch Stretch Band](https://store.google.com/product/watch%5Fband%5Fstretch). It uses a blend of recycled polyester and spandex yarns for a flexible but secure stretch, and the lugs use 50% post-consumer recycled plastic---so on top of comfort, you can know you're being more eco-friendly by wearing it.

 If you're worried about the band fitting or matching your style, don't be. The Stretch Band is available in three colors ([Linen](https://store.google.com/config/watch%5Fband%5Fstretch?hl=en-US&selections=eyJkOCI6ImQyRjBZMmhmWW1GdVpGOXpkSEpsZEdObyJ9), [Rose](https://store.google.com/config/watch%5Fband%5Fstretch?hl=en-US&selections=eyJkOCI6ImQyRjBZMmhmWW1GdVpGOXpkSEpsZEdObyIsIkhNIjpbWyJYM0JwZUhkaGRHSmhibVJmY205elpWOXpkSEpsZEdOb1gzaHoiLDFdXX0%3D), and [Obsidian](https://store.google.com/config/watch%5Fband%5Fstretch?hl=en-US&selections=eyJkOCI6ImQyRjBZMmhmWW1GdVpGOXpkSEpsZEdObyIsIkhNIjpbWyJYM0JwZUhkaGRHSmhibVJmYjJKelgzTjBjbVYwWTJoZmVITT0iLDFdXX0%3D)), and size options are available for wrists ranging from 130mm to 210mm. Plus, the band is sweat resistant, so you can wear it to the gym without your wrist getting clammy.

 At $60, the Stretch Band isn't cheap, and you'll have to clean it often since the material attracts dirt easily. Still, if you want something stretchy that's comfortable and versatile, you'll be happy with what Google has to offer.

These bands are made of an elastic silicone material with a tapered design that suits a thinner wrist and is breathable.

 The latch is elongated in the shape of a pill, so it'll stay securely on your wrist. Moreover, these bands come in three packs, giving you various colors and finishes.

 The only real flaw with these slim bands is their appearance. They aren't very versatile in their style, limiting you to wearing them as a casual compliment to your outfit of choice. That being said, they're affordable and come in various colors so you will have some options.

 Available in [Obsidian](https://store.google.com/config/watch%5Fband%5Fleather?hl=en-US&selections=eyJlOCI6ImQyRjBZMmhmWW1GdVpGOXNaV0YwYUdWeSJ9) and [Ivy](https://store.google.com/config/watch%5Fband%5Fleather?hl=en-US&selections=eyJlOCI6ImQyRjBZMmhmWW1GdVpGOXNaV0YwYUdWeSIsIkhNIjpbWyJYM0JwZUhkaGRHSmhibVJmYVhaNVgyeGxZWFJvWDNOdFgyMWsiLDFdXX0%3D), the band is made of luxe Italian leather with elegant stitching and stainless steel lugs. There are no two ways about it---this is one of the classiest bands you can get for your Pixel Watch.

 Of course, at $80, it's pretty expensive. It's also unavailable in a more traditional brown finish, which is unusual for leather. But if you want the most well-crafted, luxurious leather band you can get, this is the one.

 If you want to save a couple of bucks or are looking to add a brown leather look to your Pixel Watch, this [BOTOMORE band](https://www.amazon.com/BOTOMORE-Compatible-Business-Replacement-Bracelet/dp/B0BN2R46PN?tag=htg-v2-6dumiru-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201987&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887801%2Fbest-google-pixel-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a great alternative.

 The band ships with a tool to remove links easily, and the clasp in the middle is strong and sturdy. Miimall also says the steel will remain in good shape over time and won't weigh your wrist down too much.

 At around $20, the Metal Link Band is affordable for anyone wanting to add a little character to their Pixel Watch. The only downside is that this band isn't ideal for smaller wrists---the links are wide, and it might be difficult to remove enough if your wrist is on the skinnier side.
