##  What to Look for in an iPad Pro 13-Inch Case

 If you're considering the new iPad Pro 13-inch, you'll want to invest in a new case to keep it safe and secure. With its unique dimensions, it's unlikely that your old iPad case will be a good fit for your new device, so shopping for a dedicated 13-inch case makes sense.

 Consider how and where you will use your new iPad Pro, as this will help determine what style of case is right for you. For instance, if you plan on using it on the go, you might want to consider a rugged-style case that offers more robust protection against drops and shocks.

 Folio-style cases help protect the screen itself, thanks to the soft microfiber lining on the inside of the cover. These cases often come with handy auto wake/auto sleep functionality, making them convenient for everyday use. Additionally, the covers are flexible and foldable, supporting multiple viewing angles.

 For artists and creatives, you should look for a case that supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Plenty of cases to choose from allow for magnetic storage and charging of your Apple Pencil, meaning it's always on hand for that next moment of inspiration.

 To help you make the right choice, we've shortlisted some of the best iPad Pro 13-inch cases currently available. These selections cover various functions and cater to different budgets, so whatever style you're after, you'll find something here for you.

##  Best iPad Pro 13-Inch Case Overall: [Spigen Rugged Armor Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Designed-Generation-Pencil/dp/B0CW2G35SQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003471&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fipad-pro-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Spigen

| Pros                   | Cons                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ✓ High-quality finish  | ✗ Only available in black |
| ✓ Air cushion corners  |                           |
| ✓ Apple Pencil storage |                           |

 Spigen is always a safe bet for quality cases that won't break the bank. The [Spigen Rugged Armor Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Designed-Generation-Pencil/dp/B0CW2G35SQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003471&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fipad-pro-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fine example of this, representing an excellent price-to-performance ratio. For less than $30, you get an iPad Pro 13-inch case that looks and feels like a premium product. It has a high-quality finish and is as practical as it is stylish.

 Its sleek matte black look is offset nicely by subtle carbon fiber detailing, and it has a reinforced back panel that offers decent protection against drop damage. Spigen Air Cushion corners help up the ante, providing reassuring shock absorption should your iPad Pro 13-inch slip from your hands.

 The folio-style front cover auto-wakes your iPad when opened and puts it to sleep when closed, helping to conserve your battery life. The cover can also be conveniently folded to support both Theater and Utility viewing modes, as well. Plus, it provides secure storage for your Apple Pencil and features a magnetic clasp that keeps the front cover closed when not in use.

 Precision cutouts ensure easy access to charging ports and buttons, and its custom fit is ideal for maintaining your iPad's slim profile. For rugged protection at an affordable price point, the Spigen Rugged Armor Pro is one of the best iPad Pro 13-inch cases you can buy.

 Equipping yourself with the latest iPad Pro is expensive, and pairing it with a decent case can push the cost up even further. But if you're looking for the best case you can buy for the least amount of money, then the [ProCase for iPad Pro 13-inch](https://www.amazon.com/ProCase-Smart-Folio-Stand-13-inch/dp/B0CZ9F587X?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003471&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fipad-pro-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the best options that you're likely to find, coming in at less than $10.

 This folio-style case has been precision cut for the 13-inch iPad Pro, with easy access to all ports and buttons. The auto wake/sleep front cover has a soft microfiber lining that protects your iPad's screen, and a magnetic closure keeps the case closed when in transit. Thanks to its trifold cover, it supports both viewing and typing angles.

 Where this case does fall short is its relative lack of protection for your iPad Pro. While the microfiber lining offers protection to the screen, the ProCase's protection is a little thin on the ground elsewhere. That said, it does have reinforced corners that help mitigate damage caused by accidental drops or shocks.

 However, there's very little to complain about regarding the price here. The ProCase provides a sleek and professional look without adding any unwanted bulk, making it easy to take your iPad Pro anywhere. It even supports the Apple Pencil, adding a little icing on top of this budget-friendly cake.

| Pros                                      | Cons                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Secure Apple Pencil storage             | ✗ Arguably too many features for non-Apple Pencil users |
| ✓ Supports Apple Pencil Magnetic charging |                                                         |

 For Apple Pencil users, the [ESR Case for iPad Pro 13-inch](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Removable-Magnetic-Vertical-Supports/dp/B0CSSQ57D2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003471&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fipad-pro-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the case to buy. This detachable magnetic case supports both adjustable and fixed landscape and portrait modes, with its trifold stand enabling multiple viewing angles. A recessed groove allows you to magnetically charge your Apple Pencil while a built-in magnetic clasp keeps it firmly in place while you're on the move.

 Strong magnets built into the back cover of this case can support weights of up to 2,500 grams, giving you a secure fit that holds up well for everyday use. When you want to get a bit more hands-on with your iPad Pro, the front cover detaches completely, leaving your device protected by the back cover.

 The ESR's front cover provides auto-wake and auto-sleep functionality for your iPad Pro, and its soft microfiber lining helps keep your screen scratch and dust-free. But the real trump card is the plethora of adjustable viewing angles. It's rare to see such versatility in an iPad case, which sets the ESR case in a class of its own.

 The ultimate protective case for Apple Pencil users, the ESR Case for iPad Pro 13-inch offers unparalleled versatility, whether you're using one of its many standing modes or getting up close and personal in handheld mode. This one's a sure-fire winner for creatives and prolific users alike.

Logitech

| Pros                                      | Cons        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ Lightweight and highly portable         | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Supports multiple typing angles         |             |
| ✓ Offers a decent amount of customization |             |

 Touchscreens are all well and good, but you still can't beat a good keyboard for the ultimate typing experience. Luckily, the [Logitech Combo Touch](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.920-012658.html) for iPad Pro 13-inch can provide that experience in a lightweight and slim form factor that won't compromise your iPad Pro's portability.

 This detachable keyboard case features a precision trackpad for easy on-screen navigation and 16 levels of adjustable backlighting for a customized look. A row of iPadOS keys provides a typing experience you can only get with the iPad, while the Combo Touch's back cover supports multiple viewing angles and typing positions.

 When closed, this case provides front, back, and corner protection for your iPad Pro, while maintaining its slim form factor and allowing easy transportation. Power for the keyboard is provided through your iPad Pro via a smart connector, and precision cutouts keep charging ports, buttons, and cameras free from obstruction while in use.

 As with any keyboard case, the Logitech Combo Touch will set you back a fair amount, which is its main drawback. Shelling out an extra $250 after investing in a new iPad is far from ideal. But with the effortless convenience and fluidity this dedicated keyboard case affords, this could be an investment that pays dividends.

| ✓ Will appeal to Apple enthusiasts  | ✗ Probably the most expensive non-keyboard case you can buy |
| ✓ Smooth and smart magnetic fit     |                                                             |

 For Apple branding enthusiasts, there's only one choice when protecting your iPad Pro—the [Apple Smart Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Folio-iPad-13-inch/dp/B0D3J7739F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003471&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fipad-pro-13-inch-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This premium iPad case offers front and back protection for your iPad Pro and attaches magnetically to your device for a secure fit.

 The Smart Folio has a soft lining that protects your iPad screen, and the cover can be folded to support different viewing angles. It auto-wakes your device when the cover is opened and sends it to sleep when it is closed. It's available in black, white, and denim colorways and lends a slick and professional look to your iPad Pro, whichever option you choose.

 On the downside, the Smart Folio offers little practical protection for your device. Other than some protection for the screen's surface, there's nothing else to guard it against damage. There's no air cushioning and no reinforced backing. Plus, at nearly $100, it isn't exactly a cheap investment.

 However, as the official iPad Pro case, it looks great. The aesthetics alone will be enough to tempt Apple fans to dip into their wallets. It's slim and lightweight with precision cutouts in all the right places and allows you to interact with your iPad Pro effortlessly. Whether that's enough to justify the price of admission is up to you.

### Can I use my old iPad Pro case with the new Pro model?

 Possibly. However, this will vary on the type of case that you own. The dimensions of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are very similar to the latest 13-inch version, although the 13-inch iPad Pro is marginally thinner. 

### What is the difference between the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 13-inch iPad Pro?

 Both models share some similar key features. They both feature the M4 chip, have OLED displays, and have ultra-slim form factors.

 However, there are a couple of key differences, besides the obvious difference in screen real estate. The 13-inch model has a higher pixel resolution (2752 x 2064 at 264 PPI, compared to the 11-inch's 2420 x 1668 at 264 PPI), and weighs in at 579 grams in comparison to the 11-inch model's 444 grams. 

### What is the difference between the 13-inch iPad Pro and the 13-inch iPad Air?

 Besides the price difference, the most obvious difference between the 13-inch iPad Pro and the 13-inch iPad Air is that the Pro features an OLED display, while the Air does not. The Pro also sports a faster processor and has a marginally slimmer profile.

### Do I need the Apple Pencil Pro for my iPad Pro?

 No, you don't need it, not necessarily. However, if you're planning on using your 13-inch iPad Pro for drawing or creating, you _will_ need to upgrade to the Apple Pencil Pro, as this latest version will not work with your old Apple Pencil. 

### How will the new Magic Keyboard work with my iPad Pro?

 Apple's new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically to your iPad Pro via the Smart Connector, which supplies the power directly to the keyboard, meaning it does not need to be paired or charged before use.
