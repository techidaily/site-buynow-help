##  What to Look For in a GoPro Accessory in 2024

 As [action cameras](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/effective-methods-to-secure-and-download-asus-network-adapter-drivers/) have grown in popularity, their accessory market has exploded. You can find a wide range of them from GoPro itself and third-party manufacturers.

 But while shopping for a GoPro accessory, you have to consider how you will use the camera or what you are trying to film. This way, you won’t buy accessories you will never use. But more importantly, it’s a good idea to favor quality when buying an accessory and shell out a few extra bucks if needed to ensure your GoPro and what you are recording remain safe and sound.

 Compatibility is also vital. While most accessories marketed for GoPro will work across generations, some may not do so seamlessly or require adapters. So, ensure that the accessory you are buying is easy to use.

 Moreover, if you plan to use your GoPro underwater, invest in waterproof accessories, a flotation accessory to keep the camera from sinking, and dome lenses for good video quality. You can also get a waterproof case as an extra layer of protection, especially if you plan to dive deeper than your GoPro’s rated water-resistance level.

 So, with this out of the way, let’s delve into the best GoPro accessories.

##  Best GoPro Accessory Bundle: [Neewer Pro 61-in-1 Action Camera Accessory Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Action-Accessory-Compatible-Insta360/dp/B09XGYZ4N9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![neewer 61-in-1 accessory kit](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/neewer-61-in-1-accessory-kit-1.jpg) 

Neewer

| Pros                | Cons                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Tons of accessories | Some buyers report missing accessories |
| Good quality        |                                        |
| Value for money     |                                        |

 Unless you are buying a [Creator Edition](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero12-black-creator-edition/CHDFB-121-master.html), GoPro action cameras are pretty barebones in terms of supplied accessories. So, if you want to use the GoPro effectively, you have to buy accessories separately, which can quickly add up in terms of cost.

 This is where [Neewer’s Pro Action Camera Accessory Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Action-Accessory-Compatible-Insta360/dp/B09XGYZ4N9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) comes into play. This 61-in-1 kit has everything that most people may want, including a carry case, selfie stick, mini tripod, buoy, an assortment of mounts, and various straps.

 All accessories are well-made and are compatible with most GoPro Hero series and action cameras from other manufacturers. Plus, considering the number of accessories Neewer includes, this kit is an excellent value, especially if you will need many of the included parts at some point. But if you need something even more affordable, Neewer offers a [50-in-1 kit](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Upgraded-Accessory-Compatible-Insta360/dp/B088615CBF/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that is only about $33.

 The only drawback is that some buyers have [reported missing products](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Action-Accessory-Compatible-Insta360/product-reviews/B09XGYZ4N9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) from the kit, which you can quickly rectify by returning the kit with missing items and ordering a new one.

##  Best GoPro Head Mount: [GoPro Head Strap 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Strap-Action-Camera-Mount/dp/B0C6RKJ65W/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![gopro head strap 2.0](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gopro-head-strap-2.jpg) 

GoPro

| Pros                        | Cons               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Comfortable and easy to use | Slightly expensive |
| Modular design              |                    |
| Water resistance            |                    |

 A head mount is an excellent way to capture hands-free videos from your point of view. So, if you are looking for one, it’s hard to go wrong with GoPro’s own head strap. The [GoPro Head Strap 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Strap-Action-Camera-Mount/dp/B0C6RKJ65W/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) was introduced in 2023 and has several improvements over the company’s previous offering, including better adjustability and comfort.

 There are three parts to the head strap—the top strap, headband-only mounting, and clip-only mounting—and you can remove the top strap and use the clip mounting separately, making it relatively modular in its design and construction. The company says you can even mount a GoPro camera with just the headband on a tree trunk or pole.

 Another highlight is that the head mount is water-resistant and durable. But being a first-party accessory, it’s a bit expensive. If you want something cheaper, consider the [Telesin Head Mount](https://www.amazon.com/TELESIN-Harness-Accessories-Compatible-Session/dp/B0BLNT215F/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which also comes with a chest mount, or the [Sametop Head Strap](https://www.amazon.com/Sametop-Compatible-Fusion-Session-Cameras/dp/B01BSNPP7U/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Available in multiple capacities | Can be more durable |
| Recommended by GoPro             |                     |

 As GoPro cameras lack internal storage to keep your recorded videos and stills, a high-quality microSD card is necessary to get things started. [SanDisk Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09X7CRKRZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one such microSD card that not only meets the requirements of the latest GoPro action cameras but is also [recommended by the company](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/microSD-Card-Considerations?language=en%5FUS).

 The SanDisk Extreme is rated [UHS Speed Class 3 (U3) and Video Speed Class 30 (V30)](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-high-quality-video-webcams-top-5-combos-with-sound/), so it’s ready for 4K and 5K videos. In addition, it comes in various storage sizes, allowing you to get one that suits your needs. Also, keep in mind the maximum microSD card storage your GoPro supports.

 As you can expect, it’s shipped with an adapter in the box, so you can easily use it with laptops and SD card readers with a regular-sized SD card slot. If you want to save a few bucks, you can also consider [Samsung’s EVO Select Series microSD cards](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1GXM16/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

HSU offers multiple cases for the GoPro, but its [Middle Protective Carrying Case](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Carrying-Accessories-Solution-Adventurers/dp/B01H6M56F8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) hits the sweet spot regarding overall size and features. It can fit a single camera, a charger, up to four replacement batteries, and a couple of mounts or other similarly-sized accessories. You also get a zipped pocket for your cables. So there is a decent amount of space.

 The case is also well-constructed and uses nylon joined EVA material with fabric lining and harm foam. As a result, everything is stored securely. Moreover, the case is scratch-resistant and splash-proof. So it won’t have trouble with light rain or snow.

 Finally, the HSU offering has a handle for carrying it around and a carabiner loop.

![gopro dual battery charger](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gopro-dual-battery-charger-1.jpg) 

GoPro

| Pros                         | Cons                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Official accessory           | No bundled wall adapter |
| Bundled two Enduro batteries |                         |

 GoPro batteries [don’t last very long](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-correcting-excessive-encoding-in-obs/). So, if you want a longer video recording session, you need extra batteries and a portable charger to keep them topped up. This is where the official [GoPro Dual Battery Charger](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Battery-Charger-Enduro-Batteries/dp/B0B4DKKKF6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) shines. As it comes directly from GoPro, you know it won’t have any compatibility issues or other problems.

 The charger is compact, making it travel-ready, and features two LED lights to display the charging status of both batteries. The charger uses USB-C for power, and the company bundles a short USB-A to USB-C cable in the box. But unfortunately, it doesn’t supply a power brick. So, you will have to rely on your phone charger or a power bank to charge the batteries on the go. Interestingly, if you use a USB-C to USB-C cable, the charging speed is faster than the bundled cable. The bundled extra Enduro batteries are another benefit of going with the GoPro Dual Battery Charger.

 As you can expect, it’s more expensive than third-party options. But for the safety of your equipment and batteries, it’s best to stick to the official charger.

##  Best GoPro Microphone: [Hollyland Lark 150](https://www.amazon.com/Dual-Channel-Lark-150-Ultra-Light-Transmitters/dp/B08PKG16X8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

_Hollyland_

| Pros                              | Cons                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Compact and Lightweight           | Bulky Charging Case               |
| Easy Setup and Use                | Limited Battery Life Without Case |
| 100m line-of-sight wireless range |                                   |

 The [Hollyland Lark 150](https://www.amazon.com/Dual-Channel-Lark-150-Ultra-Light-Transmitters/dp/B08PKG16X8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a compact, dual-channel wireless microphone ideal for use with the GoPro. It’s competitively priced and comes with two transmitters with built-in mics, two additional Lavalier mics, a dual receiver, and a charging case. It’s easy to use, the setup is quick, and the audio quality is great given its affordable price point, especially when utilizing the lav mics.

 The Lark 150 operates on the 2.4GHz band, ensuring broad compatibility and low latency (under 5ms). It automatically pairs when removed from the case; each transmitter weighs just 0.77oz. They accommodate 3.5mm accessories, such as headphones, and include wind covers.

 The buttons are large, and each transmitter has a mute button. You can record in stereo or mono, and there’s also a Stereo with Safety Track Mode you can use to avoid clipping, which is distortion in audio that occurs when the volume level exceeds the maximum capacity.

 When in operation, the mics' noise levels are at a minimum, and the long transmission range makes it suitable for a variety of GoPro shooting scenarios. Outdoor performance is excellent, with the range reaching around 90–100 meters (295-330 feet). It can maintain this range even when the user has their back turned, although obstacles and movement may affect performance.

 The battery life is average. The transmitter can go for around four hours and the receiver for up to seven and a half. The included charging case extends battery life, though it is somewhat bulky and inconvenient.

 It also lacks advanced features like built-in limiters to prevent audio distortion. But, the lack of these features and the user-friendly design make it a great shout for less experienced GoPro users. It also remains an excellent choice for more advanced users seeking something in a more accessible price range who can sacrifice a few features.

 The [Eicaus Mini Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Eicaus-Tripod-Adapters-Portable-Android/dp/B0CGXCNTRT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a versatile accessory for GoPro action cameras, as it works as a small tripod, selfie stick, and extension pole. Once contracted, it’s just over 6 inches in size, which is highly portable and will also fit in most reasonably sized carrying cases.

 Moreover, thanks to its aluminum construction, it’s lightweight but still sturdy. It also provides good stability, and features a ball head to offer 360-degree rotation. Among other highlights, the company bundles all the necessary accessories, including a GoPro, to help you get started immediately. You can also use the tripod with your smartphone or a small camera.

 You can also consider [Joby GorillaPod Action](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075M92HDK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) as an alternative that can help you secure your GoPro camera in a variety of situations due to its flexible design.

##  Best Light for Your GoPro: [Ulanzi VL49](https://www.amazon.com/ULANZI-2000mAh-Rechargeable-Mobile-Vlogging/dp/B07YSF3X8K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Ulanzi VL49](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ulanzi-vl49.jpg) 

Ulanzi

| Pros              | Cons                |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Good battery life | Not water resistant |
| Decent brightness |                     |

 It’s impossible to always get the perfect lighting. So, for low-light situations, you will need something like the [Ulanzi VL49](https://www.amazon.com/ULANZI-2000mAh-Rechargeable-Mobile-Vlogging/dp/B07YSF3X8K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to light up the subject, as GoPro cameras don’t have a built-in flash. The VL49 is an external light that attaches to your GoPro and brightens up whatever you want.

 The Ulanzi offering has 49 LED beads in a compact form factor, which delivers reasonably bright light with a good color rendering index (CRI). So your subject won’t look unnatural. There is also a built-in diffuser for smooth lighting.

 Thanks to its built-in 2,000mAh battery, it doesn’t draw any power from your action camera. You will also be happy to know it can last around 3-4 hours on a single charge and uses USB-C for power. Plus, the light features expansion slots to connect multiple lights together to increase the total output. However, this may not be very useful for GoPro owners.

 Unfortunately, the Ulanzi VL49 isn’t water-resistant. If you need a light to shoot underwater, the [Movo waterproof video light](https://www.amazon.com/Movo-Underwater-High-Power-Rechargeable-Compatible/dp/B087YSXY5G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will be a better option. The Movo light can be submerged up to 40 meters underwater and is small in size.
