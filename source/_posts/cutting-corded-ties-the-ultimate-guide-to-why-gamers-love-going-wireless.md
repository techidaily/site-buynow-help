## Cutting Corded Ties: The Ultimate Guide to Why Gamers Love Going Wireless

### Key Takeaways

* Modern wireless headsets offer solid sound quality without significant compression or latency issues for casual play.
* Say goodbye to tangled cords or pet-related accidents with a wireless headset, for a distraction-free experience.
* Wireless headsets are generally more durable than wired ones, making them less prone to damage over time.

 I have burned through quite a few headsets in my life, from cheap wired ones that connect to a controller to Bluetooth sets that connect wirelessly. After ditching the cord, I never want to go back.

##  Minimal Hits to Audio Quality and Latency

 One of the major benefits of a wired headset, at least in previous years, was the fact that wired connections offered decreased latency and superior quality. This ensured that audio playback was not delayed or compressed in any way. Since a wireless set transfers sound via Bluetooth, some of the quality and crispness of the audio could be lost along the way. At its worst, this could result in noticeable delays.

 With most modern headsets, this is no longer the issue it once was. Wireless headsets still have more latency than a wired set, but the disparity only really matters if you're deep into competitive online gaming. For the casual player, a wireless headset provides solid sound quality without any significant issues. You also get all of the other benefits that come from losing the cord.

##  No More Cable Management

 Perhaps the most obvious benefit of using a wireless headset is the lack of a cord hanging from your ear constantly while you play. This can be distracting and runs the risk of becoming tangled or restricting movement if you need to step away from your game. I've lost count of the number of times my cat pulled my headset onto the floor since the wire was dangling from my desk. Since my switch to Bluetooth, it hasn't happened once.

 You still have to charge a wired headset, so it's not as if you'll be free of using cables entirely. You can always charge when you're not wearing your headset so that it's ready in time for your next session. Some even come with optional charging docks for wirelessly charging, which can double as convenient storage for your headset.

##  Wired Sets are Less Prone to Damage

 Depending on build quality and brand, the cords on wired headsets can break or wear out over time, making them unusable after a certain point. While some come with separate cords that can be replaced, headsets with built-in connection cables can fail outright if the cord wears out or malfunctions.

![Edifier HECATE G5000 gaming speakers included USB, audio, and power cable](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/78dcb142.jpg) 

 The same could be said about wireless sets since they often rely on USB dongles to connect to your console or PC but, in my experience, they are much less prone to failure. Wires can be stepped on, chewed on by pets, or just worn out through use, whereas USB sticks are much more durable. You're also less likely to be plugging and unplugging the USB stick than you are a charging cable.

##  Easier Storage on the Fly

 Whenever I step away from my setup, I typically hang my headset on one of my monitors or simply place it neatly underneath the desk since it's fairly compact thanks to the aforementioned lack of a wire. If I wanted, I could even invest in a mount to safely store it on my wall or near my desk to keep it away from my pets even more securely.

 This is possible with wired headsets as well, but the dangling cord can often get in the way and has to be managed along with the headset itself. Wrapping it around the set can also be tempting, but this can potentially damage the cord if done too tightly and it's an extra step I prefer not to have. It's a matter of opinion but tangled wires also tend to look messy, which can spoil the aesthetic of a neat and tidy desk.

##  Seamless Transition from Console to PC

 While most headsets are compatible across any platform that supports third-party headphones, wireless ones are often much more convenient to connect. With a simple USB connection via Bluetooth, switching between platforms with a wireless set is usually just a matter of plugging the dongle into the PC.

 Meanwhile, a wired headset would need to be connected to the PC directly, which is okay when you have a long cord, but a longer cord also means more slack to deal with when it inevitably drapes across your lap while you play.

 The connection is not necessarily less convenient, as it's just a quick USB connection either way, but when your PC is a few feet away like mine, it's much easier to get up and plug in a dongle than to try and make room to run a cord underneath my desk.

##  Save Your Controller's Battery

 If you're on a console, plugging a headset directly into your controller (which many wired sets often require) can drain your controller's battery more quickly. Some wired headsets connect via USB, but any that use a standard 3.5mm connection, like many console-specific sets from Sony or Microsoft will draw power from your controller.

 Wireless headsets, on the other hand, have internal batteries. As long as they are charged, the strain on your controller is nil, which can ensure longer play sessions without having to plug it in. This does mean you'll have one more device to charge at the end of the day, but the extra quality of life for your controller makes it worthwhile.

##  Wireless Doesn't Necessarily Mean Pricier

 If you're on a budget or don't want to shell out too much money on headphones, then you're in luck. Wireless headsets have become much more affordable over the years. The one I use, the [PDP Gaming LVL50 Wireless headset](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Stereo-Headset-051-049-NA-LIC-playstation-4/dp/B07NJN4VJT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003061&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhy-i-prefer-wireless-headsets-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), is officially licensed by Sony and retails for under $80.

 Other sets go for even less, with brands like Logitech and Turtle Beach offering options from $50 at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, or other retailers that sell electronics. If all you're looking for are headphones and don't need a microphone, you can find some for even less.

 In the end, whether you prefer the slight boost in quality from a wired set or the quality of life features from a wireless one always comes down to your personal needs and preferences as a gamer. If you're considering [investing in a new set](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-rated-free-wmv-video-editing-software-with-splitting-features/), take some of these tips into account while you shop around.
