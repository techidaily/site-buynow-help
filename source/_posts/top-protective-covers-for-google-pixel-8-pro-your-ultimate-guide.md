##  What to Consider When Choosing a Google Pixel 8 Pro Case

 Keep an eye out for raised bezels around the screen and camera. Bezel edges help prevent surface-level scratches but can interfere with gesture navigation if they're too pronounced. The best Pixel 8 Pro cases also shield against scuffs, spills, slips, and high-impact drops.

 Fit is crucial. Make sure you're getting a Pixel 8 Pro case and not the Pixel 8 case or [Pixel 7 Pro case](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/the-compreayer-guide-to-iphone-hdr-mastery/). Depending on your preference, you can explore various case types like silicone, (eco)leather, or clear cases.

 Look for "Made for Google" cases. These are Google-certified cases that offer the best fit and functionality. MagSafe compatibility is another aspect to consider since many of the top cases tend to be MagSafe-friendly. This might sound unusual since MagSafe is an Apple technology, but these cases have magnets built in so you can use this feature to the fullest.

 Almost all Pixel 8 Pro cases support wireless charging, so that's a standard feature to watch out for. The best Pixel 8 Pro cases may also support Battery Share (reverse wireless charging). Additionally, some cases come with extras like a kickstand and holster.

_CASETiFY_

| Pros                                                                    | Cons               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Fully customizable to your taste                                        | No MagSafe support |
| Precision cutouts, raised edges, tactile buttons, and charm attachments | No kickstand       |
| Slim profile with up to 8ft of shockproof drop protection               |                    |
| Supports wireless charging                                              |                    |

 Unlike most pre-made cases, the [CASETiFY Custom Impact Pixel 8 Pro Case](http://www.casetify.com/product/phone-case-customization/google-pixel-8-pro/impact-case-with-black-camera-ring#/16005954) allows you to personalize it with your name, style, layout, font, and text color. There aren't many cases that you can make truly unique like this, so if you're looking for style, this is the case for you.

 In addition, CASETiFY's case is 'Made for Google' certified and boasts precision cutouts, raised bezels, tactile buttons, solid grips, and side sockets for attaching charms. Despite its slim profile, it provides military-grade drop protection up to 8ft and supports wireless charging. It does not support MagSafe's magnets, but this is a small trade-off for an overall fantastic case.

 Crafted from high-quality leather, the TORRO case features precision cutouts and raised bezels to protect your phone's screen and camera. It's not purely leather, however—a TPU frame and an inner microfiber lining offers shockproof protection while still supporting wireless charging.

 It includes a solid inner shell, an outer slipcover, raised bezels, port and jack covers, a holster, a kickstand, and a grippy texture.
