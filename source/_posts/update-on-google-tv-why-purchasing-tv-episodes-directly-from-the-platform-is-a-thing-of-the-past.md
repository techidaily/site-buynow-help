## Update on Google TV - Why Purchasing TV Episodes Directly From the Platform Is a Thing of the Past

Google is removing the ability to purchase TV shows through the Google TV service. This will happen over the next few weeks across all platforms and form factors, but you can continue to buy shows through YouTube.

 On July 21, Google issued a support document highlighting the upcoming changes without explaining the reasoning for the move. The company said, "with these changes, you will no longer be able to purchase TV episodes and seasons from Google TV on Google TV devices, Android TV devices, and the Google TV Mobile app."

 Google is recommending people buy TV shows from YouTube. It doesn't mention anything about films, but the company has confirmed to _9to5Google_ that the ability to purchase films with Google TV shall remain. Annoyingly, there's no technical reason for this change. Google TV and YouTube share the same backend for buying digital movies and TV shows, so that you can watch them in either app.

 Be aware that any shows you buy from YouTube going forward can only be watched in the YouTube app or the web interface. No matter how you look at it, this will create a disconnect between your Google TV and YouTube purchase libraries which used to be in sync.

 To be clear, your existing Google TV library of purchased films and shows will continue to be available across [Google TV and Android TV](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) devices, in the Google TV app for iOS and Android, and on the YouTube website. As Google clarifies, this includes active rentals and entire TV seasons, "regardless of where the purchase was made."

 In the past few years, the company [rebranded and removed the Play Movies & TV app from the Android TV platform](https://facebook.techidaily.com/enhancing-real-life-experiences-by-limiting-virtual-ones/), replacing it with the Shop tab. Like with Google TV's Library tab, this is where you can find all your video purchases from Play Movies, Google TV, and YouTube.
