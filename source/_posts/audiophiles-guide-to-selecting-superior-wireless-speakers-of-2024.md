##  What to Look for in a Bluetooth Speaker

 Besides the obvious budgetary constraints, there are a few important factors to consider when shopping for a Bluetooth speaker. A good place to start is to consider how and where you're most likely to use your Bluetooth speaker.

 First and foremost, if you plan to use your speaker outdoors, you want to look for something with a high [water-resistance rating](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Anything with an IP67 (or higher) water and dust-proof rating is a safe bet. This will protect your speaker against splash damage or dust and dirt infiltration.

 Next, think about how it will be used. If it's mostly going to one place, it doesn't necessarily need to be something with a high portability factor. However, if you want something to take with you for more active pursuits such as hiking or canoeing, it should have a lightweight form factor and be easily attached to a bag or backpack.

 Lastly, there's the sound output itself. If you intend to use your speaker for more personal use or more modest gatherings, then it needn't be something with an excess of power. But on the other hand, if you plan to host outdoor parties or larger-scale gatherings, you want something that won't be drowned out by the sounds of nature or the buzz of conversation.

##  Best Bluetooth Speaker Overall: [Sonos Roam 2](https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Roam-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0CY6S748H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Sonos Roam 2](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sonos-roam-2.png) 

Sonos 

| Pros                            | Cons                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✓ Exceptional audio quality     | ✗ Expensive                    |
| ✓ IP67 waterproof and dustproof | ✗ Battery life isn't fantastic |
| ✓ Voice control functionality   |                                |

 The [Sonos Roam 2](https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Roam-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0CY6S748H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) picks up where the [Sonos Roam](https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-ROAM1US1BLK-Roam-Black/dp/B08Z1RP9K8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) left off, setting the benchmark for high-end Bluetooth speakers and adding some neat quality-of-life features that make using the device itself even easier to navigate. Most notably, the Sonos Roam 2 adds a dedicated Bluetooth button this time, rather than utilizing the same button for switching between wireless and Bluetooth modes.

 This speaker has built-in Alexa, supports Sonos Voice Control, and features new tactile buttons to confirm actions. Like its predecessor, the Roam 2 also features Automatic Trueplay, fine-tuning the audio to suit your environment. For its size, it produces exceptional clarity of sound, with crisp highs and mids and powerful low bass tones.

 You'll also get a durable build that is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, allowing the speaker to be used safely in the great outdoors with minimal risk of damage. It is also drop-resistant, so the occasional accidental tumble won't break anything. Connecting to the [Sonos app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003719/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/controller-app) on your smartphone unlocks customizable EQ settings, as well as additional features to tailor the sound to meet your requirements.

 The Roam 2's 10-hour battery life is reasonable, although arguably a little sub-par compared to some of its closest rivals. This playtime can be extended slightly using the power button to eke things out a bit, but there's no escaping the fact that such pristine audio will suck up your battery power. Additionally, the price of this impressive device will doubtless place it beyond some people's means.

 Nevertheless, this is one of the best and most versatile portable Bluetooth speakers. The Sonos Roam 2 sounds fantastic and is tough enough to withstand the elements. Plus, the slim and lightweight form factor makes it easily transportable to any outdoor setting.

 Choosing a decent Bluetooth speaker can be expensive, especially at the premium end of the scale. However, if you're shopping on a budget, you can still find cost-effective options such as the [Sony SRS-XB100 Wireless Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C29CL98P?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which offers decent performance without breaking the bank.

 This compact speaker is smaller than a soda can but packs a decent audio punch despite its size. Equipped with a sound diffusion processor, you can enjoy an expansive sound that fills the surrounding space with enhanced low-end tones and a thumpy bass sound. It has an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, and a UV protective coating to keep it well protected against the elements.

 The SRS-XB100 supports hands-free voice calls thanks to a built-in microphone, and echo-canceling technology allows two people to talk simultaneously without any cut-out or sound distortion. Compatible with [Google Fast Pair](https://developers.google.com/nearby/fast-pair/specifications/introduction), the SRS-XB100 provides a fast and reliable Bluetooth connection, regardless of your location.

 Sony's speaker also wins big in the portability stakes due to its diminutive size and integrated carry strap, making it easy to clip onto a bag or backpack. Plus, it can last 16 hours on a full charge, so it's no slouch for battery power, either. And if you're looking for an extra audio boost, you can pair two speakers together to enjoy a fuller stereo sound.

 Perfect for smaller gatherings or outdoor adventures, the Sony SRS-XB100 is one of the best lower-cost options for a lightweight and portable Bluetooth speaker.

| ✓ Supports hands-free voice control |                                          |

 If a battery life that won't quit is at the top of your 'must-have' features list for a Bluetooth speaker, then look no further than the [Tribit StormBox Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Flow-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B0CCJ3XHK5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This powerful speaker provides a massive 30 hours of playtime on a full charge, making it ideal for outdoor use where charging options may be limited.

 But it's not just its battery life that impresses. The Stormbox Flow offers a rich soundscape with an Xbass feature that boosts the bass output by up to 20%. And even with Xbass enabled, the battery life doesn't suffer too much. Your run time reduces to around 24 hours with the Xbass feature on for the duration, so you can still enjoy acres of playtime even with the sound output fully optimized.

 If you like to tinker with your speaker levels, you won't be disappointed here, either. Using the Tribit app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003719/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thousandshores.tribit&hl=en%5FUS) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tribit/id1581568796), you can choose from selected EQ presets or adjust each aspect individually until your audio has been fully customized to your liking. And for larger gatherings, a TWS mode enables you to easily pair two speakers together for some added oompf.

 With Bluetooth 5.3, the Stormbox Flow offers a reliable, stable wireless connection over 100 feet.

Bose 

| Pros                            | Cons                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ✓ AI-optimized audio output     | ✗ On the expensive side   |
| ✓ IP67 waterproof and dustproof | ✗ Battery life is just OK |
| ✓ Voice control compatible      |                           |

 Bose has a reputation for producing high-end audio products, and the [Bose SoundLink Flex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYPGH5R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) in this new Chilled Lilac color tone is no exception. Featuring a custom-engineered transducer, it makes your audio soar in any environment, delivering a rich and immersive sound that utilizes PositionIQ technology to optimize its output based on your surroundings.

 Using the Bose Connect app, you can customize your sound further, with EQ presets and further sound optimization features to choose from. It has an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating and is coated in UV-resistant materials, making it highly durable for outdoor use. The speaker can also float, so the odd dip in the pool or two won't break it.

 The SoundLink Flex has a built-in microphone that enables you to make convenient, hands-free voice calls. It's also compatible with your smartphone's voice assistant and offers up to 12 hours of battery life on a full charge, with a Bluetooth range of 30 feet.

 If there's a downside to the SoundLink Flex, it's the price tag. At just under the $150 mark, this Bluetooth speaker sits firmly at the premium end of the scale. However, the sheer quality of its audio output coupled with its intuitive controls more than justifies the high price point.

 If you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker to get the party started, then the [JBL Xtreme 4](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Xtreme-Waterproof-PartyBoost-Multi-Speaker/dp/B0CTP191Z3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003719&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is for you. Boasting powerful sound and a 24-hour playtime, the Xtreme 4 is the ideal choice for delivering expansive audio for all your outdoor adventures.

 Featuring two woofers, two powerful drivers, and dual-pumping bass radiators, the JBL Xtreme 4 is ideal for larger-scale outdoor gatherings. It runs for 24 hours when fully charged, with an extra six hours available when using the Playtime Boost function. Plus, it has an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, making it a durable choice for all-weather conditions.

 One of the Xtreme 4's most interesting features is its AI Sound Boost function. This uses an AI algorithm to analyze the incoming signal and automatically optimize the sound to best suit the current environment. For a gigantic party sound, you can pair two speakers together using Auracast and engage the PartyBoost mode for a truly dynamic audio experience.

 The Xtreme 4 is considerably larger than many Bluetooth speakers and doesn't offer the same level of portability. However, a convenient shoulder strap makes it more transportable, and it's lightweight enough that it won't overburden you when carrying it to your destination.

 The JBL Xtreme 4 is a premium Bluetooth speaker with a price tag to match. However, it delivers phenomenal audio in spades and is the portable speaker you need to power up your outdoor functions this summer.

## FAQ

### What is Bluetooth?

 Bluetooth is a type of wireless technology that utilizes radio waves to transmit or share data over short distances. Paired devices can share data using Bluetooth, and this usually involves a mobile phone, PC, or laptop, paired with a peripheral device such as a pair of headphones, or a speaker. 

### How do I connect a Bluetooth speaker to a device?

 To connect your Bluetooth speaker to your device, ensure that your speaker is in 'pairing' mode, usually signaled by a flashing light on your speaker. Then, select the speaker from the list of available devices on your mobile, computer, or laptop. This will initiate an automatic pairing between the two devices.

### Are all Bluetooth speakers waterproof?

 Not all Bluetooth speakers are waterproof. However, the corresponding waterproof or water-resistance rating of a Bluetooth speaker will be denoted by its Ingress Protection (IP) rating. This rating consists of two letters (IP) followed by two numbers. The first number represents the level of protection against foreign objects, such as dirt and dust, while the second number is representative of the level of protection against water damage. In general terms, the higher the numbers, the greater the level of protection provided. 

### Can I use a Bluetooth speaker in my car?

 Pairing your Bluetooth speaker with a Bluetooth-enabled device enables you to use it as a standalone audio source which you can use for streaming music in your car.
