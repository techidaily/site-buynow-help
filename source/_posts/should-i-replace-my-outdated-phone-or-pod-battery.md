 Pros

* Reach of 2,500 square feet
* Compatible with 4G LTE
* Supports up to eight users

 Cons

* Limited to mid-sized spaces

 If you’re looking for a reliable cell phone signal booster that can serve a modestly sized home or office, works with 4G LTE frequencies, and allows multiple people to connect, the SureCall Flare Cell Phone Signal Booster Kit is the perfect solution.

 This booster is ideal for a home or office as it can cover up to 2,500 square feet. Irrespective of the setting, you can connect to all 4G LTE frequencies in the United States. Specifically, the Flare Kit will support major cellular carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile for your voice, text, and data needs.

 Up to eight people can use the booster and increase their respective signals simultaneously. To increase or decrease signal strength, you can make manual gain adjustments to boost a particular wireless band.

 Unlike most networking equipment, the Flare Kit is equally functional and sleek. The booster’s plastic shell adds a clean look that makes it inconspicuous, whether on a bookshelf or in a corner. On the other hand, the same can’t be said for the Flare Kit’s outdoor omnidirectional antenna. Although designed to be functional over all else, it doesn’t take away from the overall look of the booster. Once activating the Flare Kit, users praised the reduced dropped and missed calls.

**Coverage Size** : Up to 2,500 square feet |**Compatible Carriers** : All North American carriers |**Compatible Devices** : 4G, 5G

 Pros

* Suitable for medium-sized homes and offices
* Clear and consistent signal boosting
* Sturdy, durable design

 Cons

* Not suitable for large spaces
* Expensive

 SureCall’s Fusion4Home Yagi/Whip Kit shares most of the Flare Kit’s notable characteristics. The Yagi/Whip Kit offers a clear and consistent signal across[4G LTE networks](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4g-wireless-577577) , boosting your signal for calling, texting, and data on Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and more. Not only will you have fewer dropped calls and fewer texts not getting through, but you’ll also reduce waiting for Netflix or your favorite podcast to buffer.

 Unlike the Flare Kit, the Fusion4Home Kit covers an additional 500 square feet, providing a range of 3,000 total square feet for a medium-sized home or office. However, the added square footage will cost you, as this booster will set you back anywhere from $400 to $500.

 The Fusion4Home Kit is equipped with two different antennas for accuracy. For example, the outdoor directional Yagi antenna provides hyper-precise signal grabbing, while the indoor Whip antenna transmits the signal inside. SureCell incorporated a 50-foot RG-6 coax cable and an AC power supply to connect and power up the booster.

Lifewire / Hayley Prokos

 Considering its sturdy metal design, the Fusion4Home Kit was created to be efficient and long-lasting. The booster’s construction collects the outside signal via the Yagi antenna and sends it inside to the Whip. The design also works in reverse when you need a strong signal sent out. The Fusion4Home Kit funnels data through the Whip, out to the Yagi, and back to the cell tower to send a signal. For extra support, the booster comes with a three-year manufacturer’s warranty if something goes wrong.

**Coverage Size** : Up to 3,000 square feet |**Compatible Carriers** : All North American carriers |**Compatible Devices** : 3G, 4G, 5G

## What to Look For in a Cell Phone Signal Booster

### Wireless vs. Cradle

 Not all cell phone signal boosters are wireless. Some use a cradle. You’ll likely pay more with a wireless model than if you purchased a cell phone signal booster. Conversely, wireless models can provide a stronger signal to multiple devices. Cradle signal boosters will only amplify one connected phone but will be easier on your pockets.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Band Coverage

 Cell phone carriers, small and large, use many bands with different frequencies in providing cellular service to customers. With distinct bands and various frequencies, you need a booster that can sustain your particular cellular provider. The best cell phone signal boosters cover five bands in addition to 4G. Depending on your carrier and phone, selecting a signal booster with less coverage is acceptable as long as the bands align to provide the requisite coverage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Signal Strength

 Cell phone signal boosters on the market have high-gain and low-gain antennas. Look for one with a high-gain antenna. With a high-gain antenna, you’ll want at least 5dBi if you live in a rural area without nearby cell towers. Tall buildings will likely obstruct your signal if you live in a more urban area. City dwellers will be satisfied with a lower-gain antenna.

 FAQ

* What is a signal booster and do you need one?  
 The FCC defines a signal booster as "devices that can help cell phone users improve their coverage in areas where they do not get a good signal." In other words, if you live in a rural area or anywhere with spotty coverage, signal boosters can help fill that gap. These boosters can extend network coverage into dead zones like tunnels or subways.
* Can a signal booster interfere with other wireless networks?  
 Older signal boosters tended to disrupt conflicting wireless signals, including those that handled emergency and 911 calls. However, a 2014 ruling by the FCC improved cell phone signal booster designs so they won't interfere with other wireless networks. While modern signal boosters have mostly eliminated this problem, there is still a slim chance it could interfere with existing signals.
* Do you need to register your signal booster with the FCC or your wireless provider?  
 In short, yes. All modern signal boosters come packaged with labels by the FCC stating that you must register this device with your wireless provider. These labels will have a series of guidelines that must be adhered to within the legal statutes of the FCC.
