##  What to Look for in a Mouse in 2024

 Many people don't think much about the mouse that they use. Maybe you got a hand-me-down mouse or something basic from a [keyboard combo.](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-solidify-your-bio-link-an-easy-tiktok-methodology/) You might even be using a laptop trackpad! But there are a variety of reasons that you might need an upgrade, even if some of these prices might feel like sticker shock.

 If you're a gamer, a mouse with a high [dots per inch (DPI) and polling rate](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-zoom-picture-resolution-simple-upgrades/) are important, but if you're simply trying to work, a high DPI isn't going to matter. It might even be a detriment! Additionally, an ergonomic mouse is important to prevent wrist and arm strain and injuries if you work on a computer or spend long hours at one.

 There are also wired and wireless mice. Wireless mice work great for many people without noticeable lag or connectivity issues. Wireless mice come with the caveat that you'll eventually need to charge or swap out the batteries. This is an understandable frustration, so you might opt for a good wired mouse (or a wired wireless mouse) instead.

 Many of our mouse picks will be gaming-quality mice, as many features that gamers require in their mice also translate to great productivity and browsing experience.

 With all of that said, here are our picks for the best mice currently available.

| Pros                                         | Cons                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ✓ Extremely comfortable                      | ✗ Hefty and bulky      |
| ✓ Impressive battery life                    | ✗ Not made for lefties |
| ✓ Ergonomic shape reduces muscle strain      |                        |
| ✓ Dual scroll wheels                         |                        |
| ✓ Precise optical sensor that works anywhere |                        |

 Everyone looking for the ultimate mouse for work, say hello to the [Logitech MX Master 3S](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Graphite/dp/B09HM94VDS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), your next workhorse rodent. The MX Master 3S is the pinnacle of Logitech’s quest to bring the world a mouse that feels at home on desktop and most productivity apps, while also being one of the best choices for web browsing. Better still, you’ll enjoy every moment spent using the mouse due to its supreme comfort and near-perfect weight distribution.

 Two scroll wheels, one horizontal, with the vertical wheel supporting infinite scroll, are a godsend for navigating gargantuan spreadsheets, expansive video timelines, or drawn-out webpages. And thanks to its 8000 [DPI](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-zoom-picture-resolution-simple-upgrades/) optical sensor that works on any surface, you can use the mouse on a glass table, a couch, a bed, or even on your thigh, without compromising its precision.

 And no matter whether you’re using it in the comfort of your home or a busy office, you can rest assured others won’t be annoyed by its clicks because the MX Master 3S uses silent switches in combination with whisper-quiet scroll wheels. You also shouldn’t worry about easily damaging the thing because it’s sturdy as a brick, something our reviewer inadvertently corroborated [while reviewing the MX Master 3S](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-lock-apps-on-iphone-12-pro-and-ipad-securely-drfone-by-drfone-ios/): 

> Confession time: I accidentally knocked the MX Master 3S onto the floor several times during the testing period, and it did bounce once or twice, but it hasn't got a scratch on it. Nor has it developed any new rattles or performance issues.

 The Logitech MX Master 3S has got you covered in case you’re constantly swapping between different machines because it supports connection with up to 3 devices simultaneously. You can use it via Bluetooth or a 2.4GHz dongle. Whereas the latter offers lower latency, the Bluetooth connection is fast and reliable enough for daily usage. The only time you’ll be using a cable is when it’s time for charging, which won’t occur that often considering the 70-hour battery life. 

 Talking about drawbacks, the MX Master 3S can feel too bulky if you have smaller hands. And while its reassuring heft feels great when moving it around, it also makes it less than an ideal travel partner. Finally, if you’re a leftie who never got used to controlling mice with your right hand, the comfy ergonomic design made for right-handed use will be a deal-breaker. 

 The [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG/ref=twister%5FB0C363KWW3?%5Fencoding=UTF8&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a worthy alternative for those who find its bulkier cousin too massive. And thanks to its symmetrical design, the MX Anywhere 3S could also be a solid choice for lefties, as long as you don’t mind losing access to the two side buttons.

| Pros                                       | Cons                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| ✓ Multiple preformatted DPI settings       | ✗ Low on features      |
| ✓ A variety of color options               | ✗ Cable is non-braided |
| ✓ MSRP $40, but regularly on sale for less |                        |

 Even if you don't have a bunch of money to drop on a new mouse, you can still get a quality mouse for under $50\. The [Logitech G203 Wired Lightsync Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSYNC-Wired-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07YN82X3B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has an MSRP of $40, but it's on sale more often than not and has a great value even at full price.

 The G203 is a gaming-quality mouse, although the light [RGB touch](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/simplify-slide-sharing-at-work-webcam-assisted-tips/) can easily be turned off and make the mouse look good in an office. The button below the scroll wheel lets you change between five DPI settings, so you can find what works best for whatever you're doing.

 For those looking for style, the G203 succeeds by having a nice design and offering a variety of colorways to choose from. The standard black and white colors are here, but eye-popping blue and purple colors also look great and stand out from the standard fare.

 Of course, you do ultimately get what you pay for. While you can customize DPI a bit and program buttons in the [G Hub app](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html), there are only four customizable buttons to work with. In addition, the cable is non-braided, which means that it's more susceptible to damage and more liable to get caught on things. It's not the mouse for you if you have pets that chew on wires!

 For the price, the Logitech G203 has great value and can get the job done, both as a productivity mouse and as a gaming mouse.

 In the world of ultralight gaming mice, the [Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-pro-lightweight-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-90-hour-battery-white%2F6514423.p%3FskuId%3D6514423) reigns supreme. This ergonomically shaped gaming mouse weighs just 63 grams, which is pretty darn good when compared to its peers. The lightweight design hasn’t adversely affected battery life, since the rechargeable battery inside the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro can last for up to 90 hours. 

 Another positive is the fact that, while the DeathAdder V3 Pro is on the bulkier side for a gaming mouse, it still fits inside a mid-sized envelope, which makes it well-suited for most hand sizes. And thanks to its ergonomic design and slightly raised hump that moved towards the left instead of being centered, the mouse also offers supreme comfort. The switches used here are Razer’s own [Gen 3 Optical](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU209722&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-optical-mouse-switch) switches, which feel snappy and soft enough to not feel stiff while clicking but also stiff enough not to make accidental clicks in the heat of battle. 

 The optical sensor found inside the DeathAdder V3 Pro is the flagship Focus Pro 30K optical one that offers superb accuracy. By default, the [polling rate](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-zoom-picture-resolution-simple-upgrades/) tops out at 1000Hz, but you can purchase the Razer [HyperPolling dongle](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU209722&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice-accessories%2FRazer-HyperPolling-Wireless-Dongle%2FRC30-04410100-R3M1) to enable the 8000Hz polling rate. The $29.99 dongle does its job, but unless you’re a professional gamer, the default 1000Hz polling rate is more than enough for any multiplayer title. 

 The included 2.4Ghz dongle provides low latency and an extremely stable experience that’s indistinguishable from using a wire. And thanks to the presence of a USB-C port, you will be able to charge the mouse with any [USB-C cable](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) you already own. That said, the included USB-C cable is well-made and suitable for charging purposes. 

 The mouse features four buttons on the top, alongside the scroll wheel click. And while that’s fine for any game, it’s disappointing to see the DPI switch button on the bottom of the mouse instead of being placed behind the scroll wheel. On the flip side, when coupled with a quality mouse pad, the DeathAdder V3 Pro slides around with almost zero drag thanks to fairly large and well-made PTFE feet. 

 Considering its ergonomic design, the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro isn’t suited for left-handed gamers. Further, if you have small hands, the mouse will probably end up feeling too large and bulky. Then there’s the issue with the $150 price point that balloons to $180 if you want to use 8000Hz polling. 

 If you need something more compact with a symmetrical design that packs almost the same performance, the [Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Superlight-Lightspeed-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09NBWL8J5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an outstanding alternative. Gamers who prefer weightier gaming mice should look no further than the [Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G-Artanis-WL-Black/dp/B092CB69Q4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). In case you’re looking for a no-frill budget wireless gaming mouse, the [Logitech G305](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-005280.html) might be an older model, but it delivers the goods.

Super light, super comfortable, featuring quality optical switches and one of the best sensors on the market, the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro is an impressive gaming mouse.

##  Best Wireless Mouse: [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Three variants of the Logitech MX Anywhere 3S laying on a glass table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/logitech-mx-anywhere-3s.jpg) 

_Logitech_

| Pros                                       | Cons                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Compact and comfortable                  | ✗ Symmetric design yet no side buttons on both sides |
| ✓ Great battery life                       | ✗ Doesn't come with a 2.4GHz dongle                  |
| ✓ A perfect travel companion               |                                                      |
| ✓ Quality sensor that works on any surface |                                                      |
| ✓ Quiet clicks and scroll wheel            |                                                      |
| ✓ Supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connection |                                                      |

 The [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a compact, easier-to-handle cousin of the [Logitech MX Master 3S](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HM94VDS?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). While some compromises had to be made to make the MX Anywhere 3S travel-friendly and suited for users with smaller hands, the most important stuff is still here. This includes an impressively comfortable design, a long-lasting battery with a USB-C charging port, an 8000 DPI optical sensor that works anywhere —hence the name— quiet clicks, a high-end scroll wheel with infinite scroll, and Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity options. 

 Unfortunately, while the mouse supports 2.4GHz connectivity, you won’t find a wireless dongle in the box. That said, the Bluetooth performance is stable enough for any kind of usage aside from playing games, and thanks to it being able to connect to up to three devices at once, you can switch between devices quickly and without hassle. 

 Another plus is the 8K optical sensor that works anywhere. A bare computer table or one with a desk pad, couch, your thigh, a glass table, or even a mirror; as long as the surface is relatively flat, the MX Anywhere 3S will glide across it with impressive accuracy. The mouse also excels with regard to battery life. You can expect about 70 hours of usage before needing to hook the charging cable, an impressive feat for a compact travel mouse. 

 Unlike the Logitech MX Master 3S, the MX Anywhere 3S features a symmetric design, making the mouse very comfortable to use even if you’re left-handed. The whole package could’ve been even better if Logitech put side buttons on both sides of the body, but rather inexcusably, especially considering the premium price point, you can only find two side buttons on the left-hand side of the mouse, perfectly aligned to be pressed with your right thumb. 

 If you’re looking for something more versatile with an ergonomic design and don’t mind the extra heft, the [Logitech MX Master 3S](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HM94VDS?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is hands down the best choice on the market. And if the Logitech MX Anywhere 3S is too pricey, check out the [Logitech M720 Triathlon](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Triathlon-Bluetooth-Hyper-Fast-Scrolling/dp/B087Z6LSHW?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), a once-premium choice you can buy for about $40 nowadays.

| Pros                                        | Cons                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Ergonomic design with built-in thumb rest | ✗ Scroll wheel can be finicky |
| ✓ 11 programmable buttons                   |                               |
| ✓ Reasonable price                          |                               |

 Razer makes some of the most sought-after gaming gadgets on the market. From impressive build quality to unrivaled performance, the company knows how to craft a good gaming mouse. The things that make a good gaming mouse are also the things that make a good mouse in general---and that's why the [Razer Basilisk V3](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) takes the crown for Best Wired Mouse.

 Many of its components are there to serve the gaming community (such as RGB lights and a blisteringly fast 26K DPI optical sensor), but every user will benefit from 11 programmable buttons, a comfortable thumb rest, and the ability to switch between onboard profiles based on the task at hand. The Basilisk V3's wired [Speedflex cable](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/570/~/what-is-the-difference-between-the-speedflex-cable-and-braided-cable%3F) is impressive too, as it's lighter and softer than a traditional braided cable, creating less drag and resulting in better performance.

 Razer also equipped the Basilisk V3 with its HyperScroll Tilt Wheel that offers both a tactile feedback option and a free-spin option that spins until you stop it manually. It's a unique feature, although our [review](https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/quik-fix-a-review-of-gopros-video-editor-and-top-pc-alternatives/) found it to be a bit touchy.

 Considering all the tech packed into the mouse, Razer managed to put a competitive price tag on the Basilisk V3\. You'll typically find it listed for $70, although it's often on sale for well below the asking price.

 It's a great option even when not discounted, but the constant deals and promotions make it even more worthy of a spot on your desk.

 There are all sorts of [ergonomic mice](https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bold-pfp-strategies-for-a-memorable-tiktok-persona/)\---take our [top overall mouse](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-easy-techniques-perfect-your-idevice-screen-shots-for-2024/) and [best wireless mouse](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/1723862736608-revolutionize-gaming-at-a-bargain-the-ultimate-deal-on-a-156-msi-katana-laptop-with-nvidia-rtx-4070-gpu-only-1199/) picks, for instance---but if you're looking for a vertical ergonomic mouse that will give your wrist and forearm the most relief while working, the [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the mouse for you.

 This ergonomic mouse is the only one on our list to put your arm in a handshake position, which is more natural than the position that horizontal mice contort our wrists into, ergonomic or not. The vertical position limits muscle use, preventing fatigue and working to limit tendonitis or painful strains.

 The Logitech MX Vertical does its ergonomics best with a 4,000 DPI sensor. This is higher than the traditional 1,000 DPI on a productivity mouse, but it allows you to use your wrists less as you get where you need to go on your screen. Also, like the [Logitech MX 3 Master](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Advanced-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B07S395RWD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), this is a wireless mouse that charges via USB-C, so you'll have no issues with wires catching or going missing.

 Vertical mice can take some getting used to, though, and the Logitech MX Vertical is by no means a gaming mouse. If you're looking for something ergonomic but still more traditional, check out the [Microsoft Sculpt Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Mouse-L6V-00001/dp/B00D68ZVY8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or the [Razer Viper Ultralight.](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Ambidextrous-Gaming/dp/B07TT8G59J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) For a gaming mouse, the [Razer Pro Click](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Click-Humanscale-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B08BQXL6DD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is also ergonomic.

Best Ergonomic Mouse

What will work best as an ergonomic mouse will depend on your needs, but the Logitech MX Vertical will do the best if you're looking for a handshake-position wireless mouse that doesn't have trouble keeping up with you throughout the workday.

| Pros                                                    | Cons                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Multi-Touch allows you to use gestures with the mouse | ✗ Not very ergonomic                     |
| ✓ Has a look that will match your Apple products        | ✗ Only charges via Lightning cable       |
| ✓ Easy to take on-the-go                                | ✗ Cannot charge and use at the same time |

 If you're invested in the Apple ecosystem, chances are you want to remain fully entrenched. While most of our mouse picks will work with macOS, if you want the true Apple experience, you'll want to get the [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Mouse-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B016QO5YNG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 This mouse is certainly special, with a design that screams Apple and a price tag to match. The Magic Mouse is more than looks, though---it has built-in Multi-Touch, which allows you to use simple gestures right from the mouse itself.

 With this mouse, you'll no longer think about going back to the trackpad of your MacBook as you swipe, scroll, and more with ease. If you still want the [Magic Trackpad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QO5YWC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for your desktop Mac, I won't blame you, though---gestures are too good!

 Granted, the Apple Magic Mouse is far from ergonomic, giving up wrist health for the sake of its great look. It's not easy to use with different mouse grip styles, either. But if you're not using it all day, every day, the specifics of its design won't be too much of a pain.

 The Magic Mouse only charges via Lightning cables---which you probably have around if you're an Apple aficionado---but still not the standard USB-C cable. Worse yet, the port is on the bottom of the mouse, so you can't charge the mouse and use it at the same time. It's a strange design choice!

 If you're looking for a more traditional mouse for your Mac, most of our picks here, including the [Logitech G203](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSYNC-Wired-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07YN82X3B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [MX Master 3](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Advanced-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B07S395RWD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), will work fine with your device. Other picks like the [Razer Pro Click](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Click-Humanscale-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B08BQXL6DD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209722&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F732167%2Fthe-best-mice-for-gaming-productivity-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) could require small workarounds for functionality, but they also work perfectly fine as mice.
