##  Create Unique Playlist Art Using AI

 AI is the latest trend in the market, and every company is using it to improve the look and features of their products. On [YouTube Music](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-6-ways-to-increase-audience-retention-on-youtube/), you can use AI to create unique artwork for your playlist cover picture. This way, you can design one-of-a-kind cover art that expresses the individuality of your playlists.

 To create unique artwork for your playlist, open YouTube Music and switch to the "Library" section. Then, select "Playlists."

![Playlist option in YouTube Music.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/playlist-option-in-youtube-music.jpg) 

 Choose the playlist whose cover art you want to change, then tap the pen icon on the playlist's current cover art.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Pick a theme that best describes the songs in your playlist. Let's say you choose the "Animals" theme.

![Animal Theme in YouTube Music.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/animal-theme-in-youtube-music.jpg) 

 Tap on the animal name and select an animal of your choice from the list that appears. Then, tap the current style and choose the style you want the animal to appear in. After that, select the "Create" option.

![Create Option in YouTube Music.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/create-option-in-youtube-music.jpg) 

 YouTube Music will take a few seconds to create unique cover art based on your request. You can then tap the "Save" button in the top-right corner to save the cover art for your playlist.

![Save icon in YouTube Music.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/save-icon-in-youtube-music.jpg) 

##  Connect With Other Music Fans Through Comments

 One of the main reasons behind the popularity of YouTube is the ability to comment and interact with like-minded people on a particular video. The [YouTube Music app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003583/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&hl=en%5FIN) has a similar feature that lets you interact with other music fans.

![Comments option in Album art page.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/comments-option-in-album-art-page.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The best part is that the comments section of a song on YouTube Music will mirror the comments section on YouTube. This means your comment on a particular song that you made through YouTube Music will also be available for that song on YouTube. This allows you to stay connected with music lovers across the YouTube ecosystem.

##  Follow Along Your Songs Line by Line

 It's common to come across a song where you might think, "What was that line?" To help you out in these situations, YouTube Music offers the Lyrics feature.

 This feature has been available to other music players, such as [Spotify](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-navigate-your-way-to-the-best-idevice-apps-for-extracting-content-from-facebook/), for a long time, but it's finally arrived on YouTube Music as well. To access it, you simply need to tap the "Lyrics" option at the bottom of your album art screen. With this new feature, you'll be able to follow along with the words on-screen as you listen.

##  Create Your Personalized Radio Station

 We all remember the days of radio when we would switch to a station that played the kind of music we liked. A similar feature is available on YouTube Music, where you can create your own radio station featuring your favorite artists. You also get the option to configure the level of song discovery between Familiar, Blend, and Discover. Furthermore, you can apply different filters like Popular, New releases, and Deep cuts.

 To create a personalized radio station, tap the plus icon under the "Your Music Tuner" option on the YouTube Music homepage.

![Your music tuner option in YouTube Music.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-music-tuner-option-in-youtube-music.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Select the artists of your choice. You can choose up to 30 artists. Then, click "Next."

![Next option in YouTube Music](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/next-option-in-youtube-music.jpg) 

 Choose the "Artist Variety," "Music Discovery," and apply different Filters. Then, click "Done."

 And that's about it! You have your personalized radio station. You can hit the "Play" button and let YouTube Music play songs that match your selections. And, in case you want to change your preferences, simply tap the "Tune" button and make changes as per your choice.

##  Use the Samples Tab to Discover New Music

 YouTube Music has a Samples tab that you can use to discover new music. Think of it as similar to [YouTube Shorts](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/enhance-your-gaming-world-the-ultimate-guide-to-installing-asus-970-pro-gpus/), but unlike Shorts, where you find all sorts of short videos, the Samples tab shows short music videos.

 The best part is that if you find a video in the Samples feed whose music you really like, you can simply tap the play icon to play the full official song. Additionally, you can tap the Shorts icon to see more YouTube Shorts that have been created using that music.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Recap Playlist for Every Season

 Unlike most [music streaming services](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-apple-iphone-xs-lock-screen-3-foolproof-methods-that-actually-work-by-drfone-ios/) that only release year-end recaps, YouTube Music releases seasonal recaps as well. The platform will create a playlist of some of your most played songs from a season, along with a recap of your listening habits.

 You can access your recap by going to your profile and then selecting the "Your Recap" option. Then, tap "Get Your Recap" to view your recap playlist, along with your favorite artist, top genres, and lots of other information about the music you listened to in a particular season.

Close 

##  Music Availablity

 One of the areas where YouTube Music is hard to beat is music availability. This is because YouTube is the go-to platform for many artists to upload their songs. As a result, all the songs uploaded to YouTube are also available on YouTube Music.

 This means that even if your friend uploaded a music video on YouTube with very few views, you can still find it on YouTube Music. However, this isn't the case with other music streaming services like Spotify and [Apple Music](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/most-asked-questions-about-pokemon-go-battle-league-rewards-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/). These platforms typically only focus on music with some level of popularity.

---

 These were some of the best YouTube Music features that made me switch to YouTube Music as my default music streaming platform. For you, some other YouTube Music features might be interesting. Perhaps you'd like the Quick Picks or the Offline Mixtape feature. But at the end of the day, YouTube Music is definitely a top contender, and you should definitely check it out.
