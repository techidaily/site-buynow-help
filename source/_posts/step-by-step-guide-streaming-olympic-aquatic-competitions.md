##  How Can I Watch Swimming at the Paris Olympics?

![Olympic coverage on Peacock.com](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-19_12-55-57.png) 

 All Olympics coverage is being handled by NBC this year, which includes the regular NBC channel and the [Peacock app](https://www.peacocktv.com/). If you don't currently have cable or a live TV streaming service, Peacock is the easiest and cheapest way to see swimming events.

 The platform just raised its prices, but it's still only $7.99 per month, and you can cancel as soon as the Olympics are over if you want.

 Peacock is carrying every single event. Plus, the platform will have a four-view experience that lets you watch up to four events simultaneously. You can create a custom event list on Peacock by going to the Olympics Schedule within the app. Once you add Swimming events to "My Stuff," it will be easier to find them in the future.

 NBC will air a variety of events in primetime, including a lot of swimming event coverage.
