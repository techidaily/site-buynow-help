##  What to Look for in a Travel Mouse in 2023

 When choosing a suitable mouse for travel, you'll want a wireless mouse to free yourself of unwanted cable clutter and to ensure that your selection is as portable as possible. You'll also want something compact enough to be stored easily inside a laptop bag or pocket to allow for easy transportation.

 Important factors for consideration include whether your mouse has a built-in internal battery, or if it requires separate batteries to operate. Check how much battery life you can expect from a full charge, or from the batteries you put in, as you don't want to run out of juice at a critical moment.

 Check the functionality of each mouse too, to see if it matches your requirements. If you need a precision mouse to scroll through lots of data, you'll want to choose something that is up to the task, such as the [Razer Pro Click Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Click-Portable-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B09J6RF5TV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or the [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 If you require features like customizable buttons, multi-device, or multi-OS connectivity, you'll likely want to consider some of the more premium options that provide this type of versatility. However, if you just need something reliable and functional that doesn't cost a fortune, a portable mouse such as the [Logitech Pebble](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084SX7HKB/ref=twister%5FB0CKS33CR5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great budget-friendly option.

 However you need to work, there are plenty of available options to accommodate your needs. We've compiled a list of the best travel mice across several key categories to help you make the right choice.

 The [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is bound to tick off most if not all of the must-have features on your wishlist for a travel mouse. This compact unit boasts 8K DPI tracking for smooth, precise movement, and will track on any surface, including glass.

 Thanks to its customizable sensitivity, you can cover as much ground as you need to with minimal effort. It features a Magspeed scroll wheel with two modes (Ratchet and Hyper Fast Scroll) that allow you to scroll 1,000 lines per second, so it's a great option for productivity, too.

 It works with Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux, and allows for up to three devices to be connected at any one time, via Bluetooth. Its buttons can be fully customized, or you can choose to adopt one of many ready-made app-specific customizations using Logi Options + if you prefer.

 The MX Anywhere's battery lasts for up to 70 days on a full charge, and you can squeeze three hours of use from it from just a one-minute charge. With Quiet Clicks, you can enjoy far less click noise than the MX Anywhere 3, as well, allowing you to work discreetly from any location.

 It comes with a one-month subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud and is quick and easy to install. With a fast and reliable connection, plus a competitive price point (compared to some of the more premium offerings), this portable mouse is one of the best options for remote working.

 It is styled with a smooth, flat design, which makes it easily transportable in any laptop bag, and supports multi-OS connectivity, making it a versatile choice.

 The Pebble can be connected via Bluetooth or with the included USB receiver and provides quiet mouse clicks and ultra-quiet scrolling, with 90% noise reduction on its click sound. One single AA battery will power this remote mouse for an impressive 18 months, so you won't need to worry about it losing power.

 An ambidextrous design means anyone can use this portable mouse comfortably, and its super lightweight build makes it ideal for transportation. Simple but efficient, the Logitech Pebble is unbeatable in its price range.

| Pros                               | Cons                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Four customizable buttons          | Less portable than a non-vertical mouse |
| Connects to three multi-OS devices | Made for right-handed users only        |
| Great battery life                 |                                         |

 Vertical mice are, by design, less portable than regular mice. However, if you suffer from wrist strain (or any associated conditions), you'll still want an ergonomic mouse for remote work, so that you don't have to sacrifice your health. With the [Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B09J1TB35S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) you'll find that both comfort and functionality have been amply catered for.

 Designed for right-handed use, the Logitech Lift is angled at an optimum 57 degrees to aid both comfort and posture. Its dual-wireless connection (via Bluetooth Low Energy or Logi Bolt USB), with multi-OS compatibility, provides plenty of versatility and convenience. Plus, its softly textured grips and thumb rest add a luxury feel to this ergonomic mouse.

 Four easy-to-reach buttons can be fully customized, allowing you to tailor the Lift to your needs, while whisper-quiet clicks and a smooth SmartWheel mean you won't cause a disturbance to those around you. Its battery will also last for up to two years, so running out of power is something you'll never need to worry about.

 Using [Logitech Flow](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/features/flow.html) technology, you can connect the Logitech Lift to three multi-OS devices and move files between them, making navigation fluid and effortless. And weighing just 4.4 ounces, it's lightweight enough to be easily transported inside any laptop bag able to accommodate it.

 Overall, the Logitech Lift is a fantastic blend of form and function and is highly recommended if you need an ergonomic mouse for travel.

 If you're searching for a compatible travel mouse for your MacBook, you should definitely add the [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Mouse-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B09V4LZS9S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001348&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-best-travel-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to your list of prospective candidates. Granted, it comes with a price point that's steeper than an uphill climb, but it sports a sleek and smooth design that makes it perfect for travel, and it screams quality.

 This ambidextrous mouse appears almost entirely flat and is uncluttered by the traditional scroll wheel and click buttons. Instead, you swipe and scroll on its multitouch surface, while the 'foot' on its underside allows you to glide it smoothly across the desk. It connects to your device via Bluetooth and pairs instantly with your Mac or iPad right out of the box.

 The Magic Mouse comes with a rechargeable internal battery lasting up to one month between charges. Alternatively, it comes packaged with a USB-C to Lightning cable if you forgot to top up that charge.

 It may not be as feature-rich as some of the alternatives, and it's pricey, but for a seamless experience with your Mac the Apple Magic Mouse is hard to beat. Silky smooth with a visually appealing aesthetic, it makes an excellent travel companion for Mac users.

### Why is it called a mouse?

 Since early models had cords attached to their rear, these looked a little bit like tails sticking out from the back and therefore shared a resemblance to the common mouse.

### Will a mouse work on glass?

 Most mice aren't able to work on glass, due to the optical CMOS sensors they use to detect movement and the fact that this image passes through the glass. 

 However, there are some exceptions to this, such as the Logitech MX Anywhere 3, which is specially designed to track on glass, as well as other surfaces.

### Are wireless mice any good?

 In terms of performance, wireless mice can now operate on a par with wired mice, with barely any noticeable difference. 

 With vastly improved battery life, wireless connectivity, and unencumbered freedom of movement, many users actually prefer to use a wireless mouse these days. 

### How do I clean my mouse?

 To clean your mouse effectively, you can use a lint-free cloth or cotton swap with soap and water to treat the outer surface, scroll wheel, and optical sensor.

 Alternatively, you can use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on a cleaning cloth to wipe the outer surfaces clean.
