##  What to Look For in a Surge Protector in 2024

 How well a surge protector shields connected devices depends on many factors, chief among them being the design. Most options on the market use efficient and cost-effective Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs), which receive and divert excess voltage from your equipment. But this causes them to take the brunt of the surge, making them [degrade over time](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/a-complete-overview-claude-3-unwrapped/)—they're essentially sacrificial components.

 However, some more expensive options use newer systems that ditch sacrificial parts for components that block excess voltage instead. This model shields both your devices and the surge protector, allowing the latter to last longer on average than its MOV counterparts.

 Another factor to consider when buying a surge protector is the joule rating. It's more important for MOV-based systems and is an indicator of the amount of energy and the number of surges a protector can take before it fails—so, the higher is better.

 There's also a clamping value that measures how much voltage is let through to your appliances in a single spike, with most surge protectors ranging from 333 to 500 volts—but the lower the number, the better. Meanwhile, many surge suppressors include a circuit breaker that trips if a high enough voltage manages to get through, adding an extra layer of protection.

 Just as important as the protection mechanism is what happens when the device becomes compromised. Most quality surge protectors have a built-in kill switch that makes them inoperable if they can no longer provide protection. Others continue to work as [ordinary power strips](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-emoji-filled-conversations-using-gifs-in-your-instagram-comments/) without any protective benefits. This defeats the purpose of having a protector in the first place and puts your devices at risk. All the units on our list either have an emergency stop system or LEDs notifying you once components inside are degraded.

 Finally, a warranty is worth considering should a surge suppressor fail to act as it should. Many companies promise long-term warranties that cover failures. But make sure you note down all the details if it does, or it may be difficult to collect.

 Our list comprises some of the best surge protectors available, so keep reading on to find the best one for you.

| Pros                                        | Cons          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ✓ Unrivaled surge protection ability        | ✗ Pricey      |
| ✓ Lasts longer than most of the competition | ✗ No USB port |
| ✓ Sturdy aluminum design and an 8-foot cord |               |

 Our [best surge protector overall](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-3-software-to-transfer-files-tofrom-your-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-via-a-usb-cable-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) will easily protect most devices. But if you have really costly equipment such as gaming PCs you'll want something more powerful to make sure your expensive equipment doesn't get fried. In that case, the [Furman Power Station 8 (PST-8)](https://www.amazon.com/Furman-Aluminum-8-Outlet-Protection-Conditioning/dp/B000YYVLAK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205728&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F809386%2Fbest-surge-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is for you.

 Unlike most surge protectors that use Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) to divert surge current, the Furman PST-8 uses Series Multi-Stage Protection Plus (SMP+) that provides great surge filtering alongside an automatic shutdown circuit that cuts off the power when a surge is detected. This setup protects both your appliances and the surge protector, allowing it to last longer in theory than MOV-based options.

 Physically, the device is huge (mostly long) and stands out in any setup, so it's difficult to hide under a desk or behind an entertainment center. But it should feel right at home beside the average large and LED-lit gaming PC. It has eight AC outlets, two cable satellite ports, and two telecom connectors, so you can plug all of your components in on it.

 However, all of these upgrades come at a high cost, with this surge protector costing easily double the price of most of the other recommendations on this list. It's worth it, though, for how expensive gaming PCs are to buy or build.

 The [APC Surge Protector](https://www.amazon.com/APC-Protection-SurgeArrest-Performance-P11VT3/dp/B0012YLTR6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205728&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F809386%2Fbest-surge-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is your best bet if you need a surge protector for a [home theater system](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/aoc-unveils-powerhouse-triad-the-u3-graphic-pro-monitors-for-professionals/). It houses eleven AC outlets, a coaxial port, and one telephone/LAN outlet. Unfortunately, it lacks USB ports, but when it comes to hooking up home theater equipment, USB ports aren't the most important outlet on a surge protector.

 If you want a [surge protector that doubles as a UPS](https://driver-install.techidaily.com/correct-windows-10-sounds-with-audio-driver-installation/) to keep your PC running during a power outage, the [APC UPS Battery Backup Surge Protector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y24DEU?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205728&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F809386%2Fbest-surge-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the best options available. It has a rating of 1,500VA/865W that can last from a few minutes to several hours depending on whether you have your TV, PC, and other large gadgets or just some routers plugged in. The device has ten outlets, all of which are surge protected; however, only five can tap from the battery power.

 The system has an automatic voltage regulator that instantly corrects voltage fluctuations without taking a toll on the battery. Unfortunately, it also has a beeping sound characteristic of UPSs, but you can silence it with a front panel soft key.

 If you're one to monitor your battery, there's a small LCD with plenty of information at a glance. But if you want to see all the nitty-gritty, the bundled Windows PC power-management software will give you just that.

 You can also get an [extra battery backup](https://www.amazon.com/APC-External-Battery-BR1500G-BR24BPG/dp/B0047E5B90?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205728&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F809386%2Fbest-surge-protector%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) if you have more devices or want to power your appliances for longer. And once you've used the surge protector for a while and the battery health begins to deteriorate, you can easily swap out the battery cell with a replacement.

## FAQ

### What is a good joules rating for a surge protector?

In general, the higher joule rating, the better, because the higher the joule rating, the longer the surge protector will last.

### Can you plug a surge protector into a surge protector?

You [should not plug one surge protector into another](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-reasons-why-pokemon-gps-does-not-work-on-vivo-y77t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Daisy-chaining surge protectors and adding more devices runs the risk of overloading the first surge protector in the chain, which is dangerous.

### Can you plug an extension cord into a surge protector?

For the same reason you shouldn't plug a surge protector into a surge protector, you should not plug an extension cord into a surge protector. If the extension cord only has one outlet, though, plugging it into the surge protector should be fine---but you should plug it directly into an outlet if possible.

### What's the difference between a surge protector and a power strip?

[Power strips and surge protectors](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-emoji-filled-conversations-using-gifs-in-your-instagram-comments/) are extremely similar, wherein you can plug multiple devices into them. However, surge protectors provide your devices with extra protection, while power strips do not.

### When should I replace my surge protector?

A surge protector's lifespan is measured in joules, which is the amount of energy the protector can absorb. While it's not easy to tell how many joules a surge protector has absorbed, if your protector is on the older side, it's a good idea to [replace it](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/a-complete-overview-claude-3-unwrapped/).
