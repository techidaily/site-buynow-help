## Uncover the True Intent Behind Apple's Latest Strategy on Game Emulation

###### [Read update](https://common-error.techidaily.com/proven-techniques-to-restore-functionality-of-laptop-touchpad-on-oldernewer-windows-os/) 

* **_Clarification from Apple_**

 In an unexpected twist, Apple now says that retro game emulators are allowed on the App Store. The updated policy may bring emulators like RetroArch or Dolphin to the iPhone, depending on how Apple interprets its somewhat vague guidelines.

###  UPDATE: 2024/04/15 14:31 EST BY ANDREW HEINZMAN

**_Clarification from Apple_** 

 In a statement to [_MacRumors_](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-further-explains-igba-removal/), Apple confirmed that "emulators on the App Store are permitted to load ROMs downloaded from the web, so long as the app is emulating retro console games only." The company recently approved an open-source Game Boy Advance emulator for the App Store, though it removed this emulator after a complaint from the emulator's original developer.

 The updated [App Store Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software) page now makes explicit mention of "retro game console emulator apps." It states that these apps "can offer to download games," though any software offered in a retro emulation app must comply with App Store guidelines and regional laws. These rules are not exclusive to the European Union.

 Unfortunately, Apple hasn't taken the time to explain this new policy. Emulator apps can "offer to download" games—that's great, but can I bring my own ROMs?

> "Retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games. You are responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws. Software that does not comply with one or more guidelines will lead to the rejection of your app."

 This policy may be intended solely for _licensed_ emulators. If SEGA brings a Genesis emulator to iOS, for example, it can distribute classic games for $5 apiece instead of bundling all the games within the app itself.

 Unlicensed emulators may not be covered by Apple's new policy. [Henrik Rydgård](https://www.ppsspp.org/news/apple-announcement-comment/), the creator of PPSSPP, says that it's "unclear if emulators will be allowed to let the user pick from their own files, and not just app-internal downloads." If Apple prevents users from bringing their own ROMs or ISOs to the table, emulators like PPSSPP or RetroArch will be limited to free fan games.

 Emulators have never been _explicitly_ banned from the App Store. Retro games that are ported to iOS often run within an emulator. But retro game emulators tend to violate one of the iPhone's core guidelines—apps are not allowed to import and execute unreviewed code. The [iDOS emulator](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/elevating-brand-awareness-with-tailored-engaging-youtube-banners-for-2024/) was fine when it was self-contained, but it was banned after introducing a file import function.

 Yes, the European Union has forced Apple to give users and developers a lot more freedom on iOS. But we don't know how the EU's regulation will impact game emulation. And [Apple is refusing](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-final-cut-editors-toolkit-10-plugin-winners/) to extend EU-complaint features to the U.S. or other territories. If the new game emulator guidelines are a response to EU regulations, why are they listed as global guidelines?

 We don't know how Apple's game emulator policy actually works. Until someone submits a retro game emulator to the App Store review process, the future of game emulation on iOS is unknown.
