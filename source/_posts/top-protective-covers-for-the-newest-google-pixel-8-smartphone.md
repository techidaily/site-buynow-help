##  What to Consider When Choosing a Google Pixel 8 Case

 There are currently dozens of Google Pixel 8 cases on the market screaming for your attention. But before you invest in a case, here are some key factors that are worth considering.

 A typical phone case should offer protection against daily wear and tear, including scratches, smudges, scuffs, spills, sweat, as well as bumps and drops. The cases in this roundup not only meet these criteria, but go above and beyond.

 Fit is also key. Cases need to be specifically designed for the Pixel 8, as the size of the phone is different from [Pixel 7 cases](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-5-hidden-media-extractor-apps/) and [Pixel 7 Pro cases](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/the-compreayer-guide-to-iphone-hdr-mastery/). They'll need to come with precise cutouts for easy access to all ports and responsive tactile buttons for easy operation.

 Size is also important, so we included cases that won't add significant bulk to your phone. While we have a category for thin-fit cases, all the cases generally maintain a slim profile. Also, keep an eye out for raised bezels—they protect the screen and cameras from scratches.

 MagSafe compatibility and support for wireless charging are also crucial factors to consider when selecting a Pixel 8 case. That's right—with the right case, you can use Apple's MagSafe technology with your Pixel 8, and many of the cases below support it, as well as wireless charging. Additionally, and depending on your needs, features like a kickstand or wallet are also worth considering.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Unrivaled full-body protection with 4x military-grade impact resistance | Slightly bulky with holster on |
| Port covers that block dust, dirt, and lint                             |                                |
| Holster doubles as a kickstand                                          |                                |

 For those with active lifestyles or jobs that involve frequent movement or heights, the [OtterBox Defender Series Pixel 8 Case](https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Google-Pixel-Defender-Case/dp/B0CHH9HLWW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000620&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-google-pixel-8-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a top choice. This case's sturdy inner shell and outer slipcover offer comprehensive shockproof protection while keeping out dust, dirt, and lint.

 The Defender Series features precise cutouts, tactile buttons, and raised lips throughout, while the lack of a built-in screen protector enhances touch response. Additionally, it includes a holster that doubles as a kickstand, allowing for hands-free and multi-angle viewing. Careful, though—with the holster attached, this case is bulky, making it difficult to slip into your pocket.
