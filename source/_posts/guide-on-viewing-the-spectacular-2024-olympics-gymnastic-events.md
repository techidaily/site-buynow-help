 The Olympics are being covered by NBC this year. That includes your local NBC affiliate, plus the [Peacock app](https://www.peacocktv.com/). In fact, Peacock will have every single event, and it is introducing a four-view experience that lets you watch up to four events simultaneously.

 You can create a custom event list on Peacock by going to the Olympics Schedule within the app. Once you add Gymnastics events to "My Stuff," it will be easier to find them in the future.

 NBC will air a variety of events in primetime, including a lot of gymnastics event coverage.

But you can [get NBC for free with an OTA antenna](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-a-non-functioning-steelseries-arctis-pro-microphone-complete-solution/) if you have [access to your NBC affiliate at your address](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crossing-platforms-upload-video-to-twittertumblr/) (signal strength can vary based on location). You could also watch NBC coverage by getting a 7-day free trial from a live TV streamer like [Fubo](https://www.fubo.tv/).
