 When asking the people around me why they play retro video games, they all gave the same reason—nostalgia. That got me wondering what else keeps players reaching for games from the 80s to the early 2000s. Here are some of my own, not-as-nostalgia-based reasons for loving these time capsules of art and tech.

## 1  They're a Low-Cost Way to Level Up Your Collection 

![Super Mario Land (1989) start screen.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024052718212800-483c6bbed1d1438bf0caedd31329b90e-1.jpg) 

 After nostalgia, price is my second most obvious reason to check out retro titles. While there are those rare retro games retailing for well over $60, there are plenty of popular titles in the $30-and-under range. Of course, the savings don't stop with upfront costs. Retro games don't have extra downloadable content for players to buy, microtransactions, or pay-to-win systems. The only things gamers need to buy are the hardware and the games.

 If you don't already own the retro console or handhelds that you want to play on, you can download emulators on your PC, phone, or even on some newer consoles (usually for free). After purchasing a cartridge reader, you can then [download the ROM files from the games you bought](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-video-revenue-generation-on-facebook-tactics-for-financial-growth-for-2024/). Game platforms like Steam and GOG also offer digital copies of retro games to help keep these titles circulating.

## 2  Take a Break From the Contemporary 

 An often unexpected reason I love retro video games is their simplicity. Many well-known retro titles like _Super Mario World_, _Metroid_, and _Crash Bandicoot_ didn't start out with complex storylines, and the graphics technology of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s was nowhere near what it is today. As amazing as it is to see how far both elements have come, modernization can be a double-edged sword when looking for a more mindless gaming experience without sacrificing action and adventure.

 Classic 8-bit graphics, minimal cut-scenes, and characters who only care about the mission in front of them can be the exact break you need from an intense boss fight in a newer game or even a gnarly day in the real world. Game mechanics can also be slightly easier for these retro titles if you use an emulator and [know how to remap the controls](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-spin-and-share-easy-iphone-filmmaking-techniques/) when necessary.

## 3  Explore Your Favorite Hero's Mysterious Past 

 Even though retro games didn't always focus on storylines, they still hold a great deal of history. Helping Samus Aran investigate ZDR for the X parasite or joining the Helldivers in their fight for democracy are fun missions in their own right, but knowing how the storyline has progressed and seeing it unfold adds a new layer of appreciation for our favorite heroes.

 TV shows like Fallout, Arcane, and Twisted Metal have undoubtedly brought more interest to the origins of their respective franchises. Though these re-tellings have been incredibly executed, there's nothing quite like accompanying the main characters through their very first journeys. For those lucky enough to have grown up following a hero's adventures, starting over as an adult can still be rewarding as it brings about a new perspective to these familiar tales.

 Getting back to the basics is also a great way to pick up on the general history of video games. As you play through these seemingly left-behind titles, you will come across obstacles, abilities, and secret combos that modern games have been inspired by and paid homage to. In many instances, games didn't just bring about cool new features, they also invented new genres.

## 4  Discover "New" Games 

 An old game that you've never played is still [a new game to you](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/streamline-control-switch-pro-in-steam-play/). Whether or not you grew up playing titles now considered retro, there are always "new" classics to fall in love with. You'll easily find inspiration on emulation platforms, in thrift stores, or at gaming conventions. Basically, if you can find antiques or geeks there, you can find retro games and systems.

 If you're a Nintendo nerd like me, one of the easiest options is the [Nintendo Switch Online subscription.](https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) Along with online play for today's titles, Nintendo Switch Online gives players access to NES, SNES, and Game Boy emulators along with their most popular titles for each. Members who opt for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription will also be able to download the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance emulators and games.

## 5  Spread the Love for Your Favorite Games 

 Remember at the beginning of this article when I mentioned that these reasons wouldn't be as nostalgia-based? Well, here's that little bit of nostalgia mention. Every lifelong gamer wishes they could go back and play their favorite childhood games for the first time, making their most cherished memories with their friends and family all over again. Though it's not possible (yet), watching someone else experience these games for the first time can be just as much of a thrill.

 The glimmer in their eyes as they become engulfed in a new world is so magical to witness. But it's the sweat beading on their brows while they navigate that one part that almost made you rage-quit that provides the real entertainment. Nothing brings people together like laughing together over shared struggles.

 Introducing new gamers to old titles isn't the only way to spread the love, though. Getting into or rediscovering old titles can be a great way to meet new friends online and in real life. This is especially true in larger cities where hangout spots like game rooms regularly host retro game nights and competitions.

 Whether you're a PC, console, or handheld gamer, we can all appreciate how far gaming has come over the decades. Revisiting the past from time to time is one of the best ways to not only show gratitude to our heroes of the past but also make sure these titles don't become lost relics. Retro games shouldn't be treated like they're nothing more than conversational pieces for nostalgic gamers. They can and have been the start of something new.
