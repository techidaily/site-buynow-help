##  What to Look For in an Ethernet Cable for Gaming in 2024

 An [Ethernet cable](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/expert-insights-into-toms-pc-components-and-gadgets/) can be very beneficial to your home Internet's performance, whether you are gaming or streaming. But you can't just pick any random LAN cable and expect the best connection. Here are some tips to help in your [Ethernet](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-extract-and-save-fb-videos-the-cutting-edge-of-top-5/) cable shopping.

 First, you need to settle on the category (Cat) of the Ethernet cable you are buying. A higher category number typically denotes faster data speeds, but you don't necessarily need the fastest cable. For example, the Cat-8 Ethernet cables are the fastest on the market, but because of their 40Gbps data transfer speed, they don't make sense for home use. Also, the higher you go in the category number, the more expensive Ethernet cables become. You can decide based on your home Internet speed and how much you want to future-proof your connection.

 The cable's built-quality and PVC jacket rating can also be crucial depending on where you want to run the cable. If you plan to run the cable in a wall or across multiple floors, you must get a suitably rated cable. Otherwise, you may risk damaging the cable or even your home.

 Lastly, while there isn't a massive difference in the prices of different Ethernet cables, keeping your budget in mind is a good idea. So unless you have a faster-than-gigabit Internet connection or plan to get one soon, there is no need to get the more expensive [Cat-6A or Cat-8 Ethernet cables](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-breaking-speed-limit-top-vids-reaching-100-million-fast-in-24/).

 In other features, the TrueCABLE offering is also riser rated, which means it has a fire-resistant jacket that can be used in vertical spaces between floors. The cable comes with sequential footage markings every 2 feet for easy measurement. You can choose from eight different colors, ranging from [black](https://www.amazon.com/1000ft-Unshielded-Twisted-Ethernet-trueCABLE/dp/B07LCXTFVH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228033&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F903088%2Fbest-ethernet-cables-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to [orange](https://www.amazon.com/1000ft-Unshielded-Twisted-Ethernet-trueCABLE/dp/B07LCY4WJ7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228033&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F903088%2Fbest-ethernet-cables-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), depending on your preference.

 Moreover, since it comes in a spool of 1000 feet, you get crimp patch cables of any specific length you desire. Also, spools are a much better value than individual patch cables. But if you don't want to crimp your own Ethernet cable and prefer a ready-made option, our best overall pick comes in sizes up to [200 feet](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Snagless-Shielded-Ethernet/dp/B00HEM6C7C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228033&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F903088%2Fbest-ethernet-cables-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Pros                              | Cons                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Fastest Ethernet cable standard | ✗ Expensive than Cat-6A or Cat-6 cables |
| ✓ CM-rated PVC jacket             |                                         |

 If budget is no issue, and you want the fastest possible Ethernet cable for gaming, then a Cat-8 cable is your best bet. And Nippon Labs offers an excellent [Cat-8 cable](https://www.amazon.com/Nippon-Labs-Ethernet-Cable-feet/dp/B0893FB837?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228033&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F903088%2Fbest-ethernet-cables-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Thanks to 2GHz bandwidth support, it's ready for up to 40Gbps data transfer speeds. So after getting this cable, you won't have to consider upgrading anytime soon.

 Available in a wide range of lengths, this cable uses a CM-rated PVC jacket, so it's also suitable for in-wall or in-ceiling use. Plus, unlike Cat-7 and Cat-7A cables, which use a proprietary connector, it has an RJ45 connector, fully compatible with older-generation networking devices.

 The one issue you may face with this or any other Cat-8 cable is its relatively less flexible nature. The cable uses individual foil shielding and steel braided shielding to prevent crosstalk and signal attenuation. If flexibility will be an issue for you, it's better to stick to our best overall recommendations, which is more than enough for home use.
