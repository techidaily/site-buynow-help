## Top Performing GoPro Cameras - A Comprehensive Review

While picking up the latest GoPro means you’ll get all the bells and whistles, you may want something else from your action camera. With a bit of research, you can save money or buy a specific GoPro that’s suitable for your needs.

##  How to Pick the Best GoPro for You

 It’s important to note that GoPros are primarily designed for capturing movies of action footage. This could be videos of your cycling, running, hiking or other outdoor activities you do. Since modern GoPro releases are waterproof to 30 feet (10 meters), you can record water-based adventures, such as kayaking, swimming, snorkeling, and some shallow diving. You can even go deeper (up to 196 feet/60 meters) if you purchase [GoPro Protective Housing](https://amazon.com/dp/B08FRTLX2M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for your camera.

 As GoPros are ideal for video-shooting outdoor enthusiasts, they aren’t ideal cameras for still photographers. If you’re looking for a simple camera to take everyday photos with, you are better off purchasing a [point-and-shoot camera](https://driver-install.techidaily.com/secure-reinstallation-of-nvidia-software/). That’s not to say GoPros are useless for still photography—you can still take great shots with most models, and you can also pick out high-quality shots from your video files.

 All in all, GoPros are easy to use and deliver high-quality video, as well as some excellent stills. They offer high resolutions for sharp detail and natural-looking colors for accuracy. You can also shoot at a variety of frame rates. When using higher frame rates, you can record excellent slow-motion video. This is especially pleasing when you’re shooting fast-paced action sequences.

 And you needn’t worry about shaky footage either; GoPro has some of the best image stabilization you can find. So much so that a gimbal is usually unnecessary. Once you throw in the Horizon Lock feature found on most later releases, you’ll be knocking out professional-looking videos of your high-octane activities in no time. You can also find an [abundance of accessories](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-advanced-tech-insights-on-tome-hardware-hub/) to heighten your action camera experience and develop your footage as you develop your skills.

![A GoPro HERO12 Black mounted on the front of a bicycle.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gopro-hero12-black.png) 

_GoPro_

| Pros                                           | Cons                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bluetooth audio                                | Touchscreens are occasionally sluggish or unresponsive |
| Fast USB-C file transfer                       |                                                        |
| Waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters)              |                                                        |
| Outstanding video and excellent stills quality |                                                        |
| Best-in-class image stabilization              |                                                        |

 At first glance, you may not feel there is too much difference between the [GoPro HERO12 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDDY8F9L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and the action camera's previous iteration. There isn’t much difference in the aesthetic for sure, but there are enough improvements and new features to warrant an upgrade from older GoPro models or a new purchase if it’s your first action camera. However, the enhancements may not be entirely worth it if you already own a [GoPro HERO11](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CDFGM6G3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The HERO12 features the same excellent 27MP sensor as the HERO11, and the weight and compact dimensions are identical. The 1720mAh Enduro battery remains, and while it can still get a bit hot, GoPro has improved the thermal performance enough to feel like an upgrade. The most advantageous addition is the ¼-inch thread mount that makes the HERO12 perfect for use with mini tripods, such as the [Joby GorrillaPod](https://amazon.com/dp/B074WFNNKY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It also supports wireless connectivity for Bluetooth microphones and is compatible with Bluetooth earbuds and headphones.

 Image and video quality remain the primary strengths of the GoPro. It is still the king of action filmmaking, but stills are also high quality. You can also pick out 24.7MP moments from your videos, and with the addition of HDR, details in both shadow and bright areas are sharper than ever. There’s also 10-bit color for more depth and natural rendering with smoother gradations.

 Frame rates on this latest GoPro still blow away the competition. You get 5.3K footage at an impressive 60FPS. For slow-motion, you can enjoy 4K at 120FPS or 2.7K at a cinematic 240 FPS. Switching formats is easy, and you can change between widescreen, full frame, or even a 9:16 vertical format with a simple tap. HyperView and SuperView are also available for ultra-wide 16:9 captures.

[Image stabilization](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-guide-to-sims-4-gameplay-recording-for-2024/) remains one of GoPro’s strongest assets. HyperSmooth is now at 6.0 and showcases shake-free footage. It includes AutoBoost to ensure you automatically get the widest shot possible. And, with Horizon Lock thrown in, you can go crazy and spin around for 360 degrees, and the horizon will remain fixed throughout.

 Photo and video time-lapses are just a button push away, and GoPro has added some fun Light Painting night modes for you to get creative with. However, they don’t compensate for the below-average low-light performance, which remains the biggest issue with GoPros and a difficult problem with such a small sensor.

The GoPro HERO12 Black offers notable upgrades, including better thermal performance, a new mount, and Bluetooth audio support. It maintains the excellent image quality and stabilization of the previous model, which solidified GoPro's position as a leading action camera brand.

![A GoPro HERO10 Black on a light background.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gopro-hero10-black.jpg) 

_GoPro_

| Pros                                | Cons                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| More affordable                     | No mic input             |
| Front and rear touchscreens         | No vertical aspect ratio |
| High-quality video capabilities     | Can overheat             |
| Full HD live-streaming              |                          |
| Image stabilization is still superb |                          |

 While the HERO12 Black offers all the latest and greatest GoPro features, it is also the most expensive of the line. If you want to save a few bucks and don’t mind sacrificing a few premium features, the [GoPro HERO10 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO10-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B09QD75B95?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a good choice. It still offers many of the same excellent functions, some of them older generations but still perfectly effective.

 For example, the 23MP photos are slightly behind the 27MP of the latest HERO. And still grabs from videos have a resolution of 15.8MP compared to 24.7MP. The quality is not quite as high, but they are satisfying images with sharp details and accurate color.

 But you’ll likely buy a GoPro for video, and the HERO10 has the same 5.3K/60FPS as the latest model. The slow-motion video also has the same high-quality standards, with 2.7K recording up to 240FPS. If you want a higher resolution, 4K at 120FPS also delivers epic movies with detailed slowed-down movements.

 HyperSmooth 4.0 still offers superb image stabilization. However, you must remember that HyperSmooth is GoPro’s Emmy-award-winning feature, and earlier generations claimed these awards. So, while the HERO12 is now at HyperSmooth 6.0, the HERO10’s 4.0 version is still fantastic technology.

 However, the main drawback is the battery life. At just one hour (compared to the 2.5 hours the HERO12 can deliver), it may be wise to invest in a [second Enduro Battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RKDRP22?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) if you plan on extensive video shoots.

![A GoPro HERO8 Black splashing in the water.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gopro-hero8-black.jpg) 

_GoPro_

| Pros                                      | Cons                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Impressive video specs for an older model | Lower resolution photos |
| Can live stream in Full HD (1080p)        | No front touchscreen    |
| Good video stabilization                  | Lower battery life      |
| Stabilized time-lapse videos              |                         |
| Easy to learn                             |                         |

 While there is no problem with just going for the latest and greatest as a beginner to GoPro, you may prefer less of a learning curve. In that case, opting for an older generation with fewer features might be preferable. With the [GoPro HERO8](https://amazon.com/dp/B08C7FBW4N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you can save a little money compared to the HERO12.

 With each new GoPro model, there are new and enhanced features. With the HERO8, you’ll be going back to basics. For starters, there is one fewer touchscreen for you to worry about, meaning you can focus your attention primarily on the back screen. A non-touch front display has limited information on essentials, such as battery level, shooting mode, resolution, and frame rate—making everything much simpler.

 The 12MP camera has a resolution of around half that of more recent models, but the image quality is still decent. However, the HERO8 still has some impressive video specs. If you want superior detail, you can shoot in 4K at up to 60FPS, and if you’re after those slow-motion moments, then you can shoot in 2.7K at up to 120FPS, or you have the option of Full HD at up to 240FPS with excellent results. You can also live stream in Full HD (1080p), and the HyperSmooth 2.0 stabilization offers three simple settings: On, High, and Boost.

 There’s also the TimeWarp 2.0 feature, which allows you to capture perfectly stabilized time-lapse videos. It automatically adjusts the speed of the time-lapse based on various external factors, including your motion, lighting conditions, and the scene being recorded. You can even get creative and slow the time-lapse down to real-time, which is a good technique for highlighting meaningful moments, then speed it back up again.

 The [GoPro HERO12 Black Creator Edition](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Creator-Edition-Includes-Volta-Battery-Grip-Tripod-Remote-Media-Mod-Light-Enduro-Battery-Carrying-Case/5028518890) is a carefully put-together bundle for vloggers. It features the latest and greatest GoPro plus accessories that vloggers need to get started. These include a Volta battery grip, a GoPro Media Mod, a Go Pro Light Mod, and an Enduro Battery.

 Of course, the HERO12 in this pack is the exact same camera as our top overall pick. It’s the most feature-packed GoPro to date and has all the bells and whistles. These include up to 5.3K video recording, superb slow-motion capabilities at up to 240FPS, HDR photo and video, HyperSmooth 6.0 video stabilization with AutoBoost, and a built-in Horizon Lock.

 The extras for vloggers make it a nice little starter pack, especially for novices. With the Volta battery grip, you have a comfortable grip to attach the GoPro. Its built-in 4,600mAh battery also extends the life of the HERO12 by up to 35 percent. You can record a 4K/30FPS video for over five hours. The grip also features integrated camera buttons for effortless one-handed control, legs you can flip out to use as a tripod, and wireless capabilities to use it as a remote control.

 The pack also contains the GoPro Light Mod. This is an LED with a diffuser that provides soft and balanced light. It fits on the top of the camera and gives you access to natural-looking light wherever you are.

 Then there is the GoPro Media Mod, which provides vloggers with better audio. It has a built-in shotgun mic that helps with clarity when there’s a lot of ambient noise. Beside the mic is a 3.5mm port for adding an extra external microphone, so vloggers looking to utilize a lavalier can do so. The Media Mod also has a handy HDMI port, a USB-C port, and two cold shoe mounts for attaching other accessories.

##  Best Small GoPro: [GoPro HERO11 Black Mini](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO11-Black-Mini-Stabilization/dp/B0BKNL3F92?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![A GoPro HERO11 Mini on a light background.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gopro-hero11-mini.jpg) 

_GoPro_

| Pros                                       | Cons                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters)          | Lacks a photo mode           |
| 8:7 aspect ratio for easy cropping         | No built-in display          |
| Dual mounting options                      | Cannot remove the battery    |
| Compact and lightweight                    | The battery can get very hot |
| Video quality comparable to regular HERO11 |                              |
| Easy to use                                |                              |

 While all GoPros are small, you may be looking for something even more compact and lightweight. In that case, the[GoPro HERO11 Black Mini](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO11-Black-Mini-Stabilization/dp/B0BKNL3F92?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is your best bet. Despite dimensions of just 2x2 x1.5 inches and a weight of only 4.7oz, GoPro still has an impressive number of features packed into its small frame.

 It’s primarily designed for video, more so than other GoPros. More specifically, it is used for shooting video from angles regular GoPros can’t reach. Its dual mounting options facilitate this. The clips on the bottom are identical to any regular GoPro and serve the same purpose, but a second set on the back is there for helmet mounting and recording point-of-view video. The lighter weight also makes a difference when mounting to a helmet. However, the second clip-set replaces the display. So, if you want to watch your footage, you must do so via your smartphone.

 As GoPro has gone all out on video with this action camera, there is no still photography option. However, you can still pull up to 24.7MP shots from your video. Capturing footage is as simple as pointing and shooting. You can use this semi-automatic mode for convenience, or switch from Easy Controls to Pro Controls. Here, you can choose your resolution and frame rate, among other settings, to get precisely the shots you have in mind. You get 5.3K at up to 60FPS and 4K at up to 120FPS or 2.7K at up to 240FPS for slow-motion, and there are also quality time-lapse options.

 This GoPro version runs HyperSmooth 5.0, which is just one generation short of the HERO12\. Together with the built-in Horizon Lock, it performs admirably.

 But the battery life is bang average, and you can’t swap it out. So when it’s out of juice, you need to wait for it to recharge. You’ll get around an hour at high settings, a bit less when recording 5.6K, which is around the same time you would get with the regular-sized HERO11\. However, you need to note that the battery can get very hot. It isn’t advisable to wear the camera next to your bare skin when recording.

## FAQ

### What is a GoPro?

 GoPro is a brand of action camera. They are known for their compact, rugged, and waterproof designs. They are primarily used to capture high-quality video footage and are popular for shooting adventure sports and any other activities where a traditional camera may prove to be impractical. You can attach a GoPro to your helmet, car, bicycle, or wherever you can to create unique angles and perspectives.

### Why should I purchase an action camera?

 The standout reasons are practicality and versatility. You can easily take a GoPro to places you might not want to take a DSLR or other traditional camera. For example, a conventional camera would be cumbersome and dangerous to wear around your neck while rock climbing, and you wouldn’t take one anywhere near the water. 

 With their lightweight and compact builds, you can also mount them and literally forget about them. They have the features to ensure your footage is great, and their batteries are generally long enough to record for a reasonable length of time. However, there are many other[reasons to purchase an action camera](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-tactical-steps-to-download-securely-free-vlc-media-on-mac/).

### What's the difference between an action camera and a smartphone?

[Action cameras](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/effective-methods-to-secure-and-download-asus-network-adapter-drivers/) are compact, rugged, and often waterproof cameras. They are designed for capturing quality video in a variety of conditions, including extreme. They feature wide-angle lenses and various mounting options. 

 Smartphones are multifunctional devices that may or may not have an advanced camera. Flagship smartphones, such as the[Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-profit-strategies-for-vimeo-content-creators/) or the[iPhone 15](https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-a-memorable-honeymoon-video/), certainly have outstanding camera functionality. But they are more suitable for everyday photography and videography. They are not tailored for adventure and sports and don’t offer the same durability or hands-free recording.

### Are GoPros waterproof?

 All modern GoPros are waterproof down to 30 feet (10 meters). Any lower than this and you will need protective housing. Buying the official [GoPro Protective Housing](https://amazon.com/dp/B08FRTLX2M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) lets you dive deep to around 196 feet (60 meters). However, you can save some bucks by opting for unofficial merchandise, such as those on offer from [FitStill](https://amazon.com/dp/B08LD4VXGL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [HONGDAK](https://amazon.com/dp/B08PK298HB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003877&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gopros%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), for budget-friendly options that still allow you to go to the same depths.
