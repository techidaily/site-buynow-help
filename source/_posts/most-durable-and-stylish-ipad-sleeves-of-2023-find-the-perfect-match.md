##  Best iPad (9th Generation) Cases

 While a new generation of the standard iPad is available, Apple is still supporting the ninth-generation iPad. If you're looking to pick up this iPad version, make sure you get the right case. The two generation's cases are incompatible, so double-check which generation you bought.

##  Best iPad (10th Generation) Cases

 If you're looking for the latest iPad model, you can't go wrong with the 2022 iPad, which is the tenth-generation model. Just make sure you don't buy the cases for the ninth-generation iPad! Our buying guide will steer you right.

##  Best iPad Mini Cases

 If you need a compact tablet, look no further than the iPad Mini. This smaller model has all the functionality you love from Apple, but is easier to slide into a purse or bag. It's a perfect [eReader](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/) replacement, as well!

##  Best iPad Air Cases

 The iPad Air is [our favorite iPad model](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-screen-content-on-huawei-mate-10-20-and-p-series-phones-via-built-in-recorders/) for a reason. It's the perfect combination of size, functionality, and price. The Air is a great starting point if you're unsure which model to pick up.

##  Best iPad Pro 11-inch Cases

 More of a tablet power user? The iPad Pro is the model to get. While the 11-inch iPad Pro model is the smaller of the two Pros, it has the same specs as the other iPad Pro model---and is cheaper, as well. Just make sure you grab the right size case!

##  Best iPad Pro 12.9-inch Cases

 There's a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro model in 2022, so if you want the latest, greatest, and most powerful, this is the model to buy. This is also your best choice if you're looking for [a laptop replacement](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/). Make sure you're not getting a case for the smaller Pro, though.
