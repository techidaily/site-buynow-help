## Latest Update: Paramount+ Begins Phasing Out Selected Shows and Movies

Paramount+ is the streaming home of Paramount movies, CBS shows, some exclusive content and sports, and even new and old childrens' Nickelodeon shows. However, some of that Nickelodeon content is disappearing from the platform, as another example of streaming services cutting back on their libraries.

 Paramount+ has announced that it is removing ten Nickelodeon original series from its platform. Among the axed shows were the Blue’s Clues revival "Blue’s Clues & You!" (2019), "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" (2019-2022), "It’s Pony" (2020-2022), "Middlemost Post" (2021-2022), "Ollie’s Pack" (2020), "Ryan’s Mystery Playdate" (2019-2023), "Santiago of the Seas" (2020), "That Girl Lay Lay" (2021-2024), as well as the made-for-Paramount+ productions "Big Nate" (2022) and the "Rugrats" reboot (2021). Other platforms, [such as Max](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-things-you-need-to-know-about-wipe-datafactory-reset-for-nokia-c22-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/), have removed popular original titles as well in the past, so this is not a new strategy by any means.

 The decision aligns with a broader content removal strategy outlined during Paramount Global's Q4 earnings call on February 28\. Paramount Global explained that the move was part of a shift towards prioritizing content with mass global appeal, leading to the rationalization of original content on Paramount+ and enhancements in linear network programming efficiency. Despite Nickelodeon's Kids & Family content consistently ranking among the most watched and re-watched programming on Paramount+, the removals were deemed necessary as part of the company's international content strategy review. Consequently, Paramount+ anticipates significant programming charges of approximately $700 million to $900 million during the first quarter of 2024.

 Still, given that Nick shows are basically one of the biggest reasons why people get Paramount+, it's probably not great for a lot of people to see the streaming platform crack down on that very content. Even if most of those shows were not all that popular, if you were expecting to catch up to the Rugrats reboot, you probably can't do so now, but you will have to keep paying the same price each month for Paramount+.

 It's not clear if the shows that were removed will be reintroduced or made available on any other platform or any other way.
