##  Finding the Right Mouse Pad in 2024

 Buying a new mouse pad might seem as easy as grabbing the first one you see online or in a store, but it can be a more difficult task if you're shopping for something specific to fit your workflow and desk setup.

 Certain mouse pads might be better at tracking the laser on your mouse for improved pointer accuracy, but they can be less comfortable to use long-term. On the other hand, you might be able to find the most comfortable mouse pad on the market, but that doesn't mean it'll increase the tracking performance over your bare desk.

 So before diving into the world of mouse pads, it's always important to set your priorities. Do you want something with added wrist comfort? How about one with better tracking? Do you prefer a hard surface for your mouse or something soft? Are RGB lights a requirement to take your gaming rig to the next level?

 No matter what you're looking for, we've got you covered with our picks for some of the best mouse pads out there.

### Do I need a mouse pad to use my mouse?

 A mouse pad provides a smoother surface for your mouse to scroll on and improves the accuracy and responsiveness of your mouse. It also helps to reduce wear and tear, prolonging the life of your mouse, while protecting your desk from scratches. So, yes, using a mouse pad is a good idea.

### What's the difference between a mouse pad and a desk pad?

 The primary difference between a mouse pad and a desk pad is in their sizes. While a mouse pad like the 3XL Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma RGB Mouse Pad is super large (for a mouse pad), it is still significantly smaller than the average desk pad. Similarly, the mouse pad is essentially designed for the mouse and maybe the keyboard, while the desk pad is designed to cover desks, double as a mouse pad, writing pad, and so on.
