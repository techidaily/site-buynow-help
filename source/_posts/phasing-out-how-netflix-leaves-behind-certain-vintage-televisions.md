## Phasing Out: How Netflix Leaves Behind Certain Vintage Televisions

As time goes by, some of our older hardware will eventually get abandoned It might still be perfectly usable, but whether it's because of technical limitations or because of arbitrary decision, they get dropped by developers eventually. Unfortunately, Netflix is now ending support for some older smart TVs and Apple TV streaming players.

[Netflix](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-infinix-smart-7-hd-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) is set to discontinue support for older models of Apple TVs and Sony TVs in the coming months, impacting people who own second and third-generation Apple TVs released over a decade ago, as well as some 2014 Sony Bravia models. The company stated that the move, at least in the case of Apple TVs, is aimed at ensuring the "best possible Netflix experience," suggesting that the older devices may no longer be able to provide optimal streaming quality or support newer features. For Apple TV users, this change will take effect after July 31st, while Sony TV owners will lose access to Netflix on July 24th. In the case of Sony TVs, the change was announced by Sony rather than Netflix.

 Under Apple's policy, the first three generations of Apple TVs are classified as obsolete, meaning they no longer receive software updates or support. Eventually, apps would've eventually stopped working on this older software anyway. The affected Sony TVs are at least ten years old, too, which is an okay lifespan for a TV. A TV is not really something you replace every year, after all.

 Netflix has previously discontinued support for other older devices, including Samsung and Vizio smart TVs, as well as first-generation Roku boxes, primarily due to changes in DRM technology. The reason why support is ending on these Apple and Sony TVs is probably, more than anything, related to the fact that these are extremely old devices.

 For those who want to continue accessing Netflix, you'll want to either upgrade to a newer device or use an alternative streaming player like Roku or Fire TV. If you have an older TV, a new streaming device is an easy plug and play solution, while if you have an Apple TV, it's not hard to find deals on newer models.
