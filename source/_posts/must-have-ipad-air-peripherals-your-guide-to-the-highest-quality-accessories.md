##  What to Focus on When Shopping for iPad Air M2 Accessories

 The most important thing when shopping for accessories for your new [iPad Air with the M2 chip](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tactical-co-creation-youtube-and-brand-joint-efforts/) is compatibility, especially if you’ve bought the 13-inch version. Cases, screen protectors, and keyboards are usually only compatible with the latest generation of the iPad Air, especially those made for the new 13-inch version.

 Regarding cases, you can pick between folio-type cases, which are usually pricier, and regular cases that only protect the rear side of your iPad Air. A folio case is the best case for most tablets for several reasons—it protects your screen from the stuff inside your bag, virtually all of them have a built-in kickstand, and you can take advantage of the tablet's auto-sleep features.

 If you’re a creator or just someone who likes to use their tablet with a stylus, you should get a case with stylus storage. Just don’t forget that most of the models are compatible with the [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and other styluses that have similar dimensions. They won’t, for example, fit the [Logitech Crayon,](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-accessories/ipad-digital-pencil-crayon.914-000070.html) which is wider than the Apple Pencil.

 As for the screen protector, I recommend getting one with an installation kit because a kit greatly alleviates the process of installing the protector. Also note that there are protectors out there that emulate a paper-like surface, making the feeling of drawing on your tablet nicer and closer to the feeling of drawing on paper.

 A keyboard with a trackpad can be super handy because touching the screen every time you want to interact with it while typing can be excruciating. A high-end model with nice, tactile keys is the right choice for heavy typists, but a solid budget option can also be the right choice if you don’t plan on writing essays worth of text daily.

 Moving on to headphones, any headphones or earbuds should do as long as they support Bluetooth connection. But for the best experience, get the [AirPods](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0BDHWDR12?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The latter are pretty pricey compared to other true wireless buds, but they offer excellent sound quality, superb active noise-canceling (ANC), and work seamlessly with Apple products. If you're after over-ear headphones, the [AirPods Max](https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are the logical choice, but you could also get something else, such as the [Sony - WH1000XM5](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-wh1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones-black%2F6505727.p%3FskuId%3D6505727) or the [Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Cancelling-Headphones-Comfortable-Bluetooth/dp/B08HMWZBXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Last but not least, let’s talk about chargers. The latest iPad Air comes with a 20W USB-C power adapter, which provides enough juice to charge your iPad Air relatively quickly. You can get something more powerful, but I wouldn’t get anything more powerful than the [Apple 30W USB-C Power Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-30W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08F9HGJS6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) because the iPad Air tops out somewhere between 20W and 30W. On the other hand, if you want an adapter that'll work with a variety of devices, the [Anker 736 Nano II](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) tops out at 100W and fully supports Apple products.

 Okay, we’ve covered the most important things to consider when shopping for accessories for your iPad Air. Now, let us show you the best accessories you can find for it.

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Well-made                     | ✗ Expensive                                 |

 The [OtterBox Statement Series Studio Case for iPad Air M2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRH72ZM/A/otterbox-statement-series-studio-case-for-ipad-air-11-inch-m2-blue) is a high-end folio case made of [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) with soft fabric padding on the inside that will keep your iPad Air safe from drops while being very soft to the touch. The case is a bit thicker, but this tradeoff is acceptable, considering the level of drop protection being offered here.

 When you don't want anything covering the screen, you can detach the front part of the case and reconfigure it as an adjustable kickstand. The stand freely moves to give you a perfect angle for any scenario, whether typing, watching movies or TV shows, or drawing.

 And while discussing drawing, the OtterBox Statement Series Studio Case comes with a compartment for storing the Apple Pencil. This folio case features superb build quality but also a pretty high price and is only available in two colors, so these may be dealbreakers for you.

 If you need something more affordable but still well-built, check out the [ZAGG Crystal Palace Folio iPad Air 13-inch](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Crystal-Palace-Folio-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CZGQBHBT?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [the version compatible with the 11-inch model](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Crystal-Palace-Folio-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CZGRYVP1?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). There’s also the [Ultra Hybrid Pro](https://www.spigen.com/collections/ipad-air/products/ipad-air-series-case-ultra-hybrid-pro?variant=42633295593519) case from Spigen that has a better-looking rear cover. Both of these cases come with Apple Pencil storage.

Best iPad Air Case

#####  OtterBox Statement Series Studio Case

The OtterBox Statement Series Studio Case for iPad Air M2 is a fantastic folio-style case that not only looks great but also keeps your iPad Air safe from drops and bumps while carrying it in a backpack.

##  Beet iPad Air Screen Protector: [Spigen GLAS.tR EZ FIT](https://www.spigen.com/collections/ipad-air/products/ipad-air-series-glas-tr-ez-fit?variant=42633377677359) 

![The Spigen GLAS.tR EZ FIT screen protector compatible with the iPad Air M2.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/spigen-glas-tr-ez-fit-for-ipad-air-m2.png) 

_Spigen_

| Pros                              | Cons           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| ✓ Excellent oleophobic coating    | ✗ A bit pricey |
| ✓ Comes with an installation tray |                |

 Spigen’s screen protectors are always great, and the [Spigen GLAS.tR EZ FIT](https://www.spigen.com/collections/ipad-air/products/ipad-air-series-glas-tr-ez-fit?variant=42633377677359) for the latest iPad Air M2 is no exception. The protector comes with a handy installation kit that makes putting it on a breeze and won’t take much of your time.

 The protector is made of tempered glass and has a superb [oleophobic coating](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-partnerships-crafting-brand-joint-ventures-on-youtube/) that will not come off over time. The price is a bit high, but considering the quality of the product, a small premium is worth it.

 If you’re a creator who wants a screen protector that offers a paper-like feel when drawing with a stylus, the [Paper Touch EZ Fit](https://www.spigen.com/collections/ipad-air/products/ipad-air-series-paper-touch-ez-fit?variant=42633364340783) is an excellent choice. Just remember that it doesn’t provide the same level of protection as the regular version and that the matte finish might make colors a bit less saturated compared with the regular version or without a protector at all.

| ✓ Includes a squeeze sensor for activating in-app tools | ✗ Not compatible with older iPads |
| ✓ Features a rotation-sensitive gyroscope               |                                   |

 The new [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might look the same as the previous [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but it packs several new tricks inside its body. It has haptic feedback, a squeeze sensor with which you can activate different tools in apps, and a super-precise gyroscope that makes the Apple Pencil Pro rotation-sensitive, which can be a game-changer for your digital artwork.

 On the other hand, the $129 price point is too high for most iPad Air owners except those who are planning to use it on a daily basis. If you just want a solid stylus you can use to write down notes or play in drawing apps, the regular [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect choice.

 There’s also the [Logitech Crayon](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-accessories/ipad-digital-pencil-crayon.914-000070.html) that works well and is more affordable than both Apple options.

| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ✓ Offers laptop-like typing experience     | ✗ High price                 |
| ✓ Includes a multi-touch trackpad          | ✗ Doesn't cover iPad's sides |

| ✓ Comes with an extra USB-C port           |                              |
| ✓ Excellent build quality                  |                              |

 The Apple Magic Keyboard is the gold standard for iPad keyboards, so if you want the best keyboard out there for your iPad Air, you know which one to get. You can pick between the [11-inch](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [13-inch versions](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro-12-9-inch/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The biggest advantage of the Magic Keyboard is that it offers a fantastic typing feel as well as a magnetically attachable back cover, a detachable keyboard that also magnetically attaches to your iPad, and a relatively small but helpful trackpad that supports multitouch gestures in iPadOS.

 The Magic Keyboard's best feature is its backlit keys, which provide a laptop-like typing experience with nice tactile feedback. The keyboard also offers an extra USB-C port for pass-through charging, which is always lovely.

 The biggest downside here is the price, which is quite a bit high despite the premium build quality and terrific typing experience. Another minus is that, while the magnetic attachment mechanism works well, it leaves the sides of the iPad bare naked and exposed to the elements. Also, despite the constant complaints, Apple still doesn’t include the function key row, which is a shame.

 The [Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-air.920-012608.html) for iPad Air is the best alternative. It doesn’t provide the same fantastic typing feel as the Magic Keyboard, and it doesn’t feature the magnetic attachment mechanism, but it costs less, packs function keys, covers your whole iPad sides included, and features a slightly bigger trackpad than the Magic Keyboard.

If you just bought an iPad Air and want the absolute best typing experience, look no further than the Apple Magic Keyboard. This is a gold standard for the iPad typing experience, for good reason.

| Pros                                   | Cons                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Admirable sound quality              | ✗ Call quality could've been better |
| ✓ Best-in-class ANC                    |                                     |
| ✓ Superb transparency mode             |                                     |
| ✓ Excellent battery life               |                                     |
| ✓ Spatial Audio is more than a gimmick |                                     |

 The second generation of the Apple AirPods Pro is one of the best true wireless earbuds out there, period. They offer excellent sound, best-in-class ANC, Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio that sounds fantastic, and great battery life.

 Another great thing about the AirPods Pro 2nd Gen is their fantastic transparency mode, which sounds like not wearing earbuds and is one area where Apple leaps and bounds over the competition.

 Conversely, the price could be a bit lower, and the call quality could be better. It’s not flat-out bad, but it’s noticeably worse than what you get with other TWS earbuds. The regular [AirPods](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) present a worthy alternative if you want something more affordable without ANC.

 On the other hand, if the iPad Air is the sole Apple product you own, you should check the [Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Conversation-Resistant/dp/B0B2SFVRC2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which sounds a bit better than AirPods Pro but also have less impressive ANC. As for the budget alternatives, the [OnePlus Buds 3](https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Splendid-Immersive-Playtime-Bluetooth/dp/B0CS14V6B8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Soundpeats Air4 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/SoundPEATS-Air4-Pro-Cancelling-Multipoint/dp/B0CHS56Z85?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) provide lots of bang for your buck at $99.99 and $78.99, respectively.

 If you're after a pair of over-ear headphones, the [AirPods Max](http://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best overall choice. The [Sony WH1000XM5](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-wh1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones-black%2F6505727.p%3FskuId%3D6505727) headphones are a great alternative, and the [Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Cancelling-Headphones-Comfortable-Bluetooth/dp/B08HMWZBXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) cans are a pretty solid budget option.

![Apple 30W Power Adapter](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple-30w-power-adapter.png) 

_Apple_

| Pros                                      | Cons                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ✓ More than enough power for the iPad Air | ✗ Doesn't include a cable        |
| ✓ Works great with Apple devices          | ✗ Packs only a single USB-C port |
| ✓ Fairly priced                           |                                  |

 If you live in the US, you’re getting a 20W power adapter with the iPad Pro. That's enough for the device, considering it tops out somewhere between 20W and 30W regarding the maximum charging power. If you live in the UK or Europe, you won’t get a charger bundled with your iPad Air, which means you’ll need to get one.

 The best overall choice is the [Apple 30W USB-C power adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-30W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08F9HGJS6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), especially if you’re deep into the Apple ecosystem. The max power of 30W is good enough for iPhones, the Vision Pro, and every iPad model. As for the negatives, it doesn’t come with a charging cable.

 If you’re looking for an all-around charger, get the [Anker 736 Nano II](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q61T39G?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003160&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-air-m2-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is a fantastic power adapter that tops out at 100W and offers full support for every Apple product but is also great for Android phones and tablets, light laptops, TWS headphones, handheld consoles, and every device with a rechargeable battery. It packs three USB ports, is quite compact due to its [GaN design](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oppo-a79-5g-bootloop-problem-how-to-fix-it-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and doesn’t break the bank.

### Can I use any pair of headphones with the iPad Air?

 If you have a pair of wireless headphones, as long as they support Bluetooth connection, you'll be fine. If you own a pair of wired headphones with a 3.5mm audio jack, you'll need a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter to use them with your iPad Air. If you own USB-C wired headphones, they should work without issues. 

### What is the difference between an iPad Air and the standard iPad?

 The iPad Air is more powerful than the standard iPad, it comes in two screen sizes instead of just one, it's got a better display with more saturated colors, faster Wi-Fi, and it's noticeably more expensive than the standard iPad. Also, if you're an artist, it's worth noting that the standard iPad doesn't support the latest Apple Pencil Pro, while the iPad Air M2 does.
