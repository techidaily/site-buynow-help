##  What to Look For in an iPad Case in 2023

[Apple iPads](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-ways-to-boost-your-snapchat-engagement/) are surprisingly tough, but anything made of glass and metal will still be somewhat prone to damage. This is especially true if you take your iPad everywhere with you, but even at home, a drop can ding or scratch your tablet. Therefore, it's a good idea to get a case!

 Cases come in varying degrees of protection, and an iPad case that's at home on a construction site isn't necessarily the best for other scenarios. You need to make sure your case provides enough protection for the situations you'll use it in, but there's also no need to go overboard if the iPad will be used by your family.

 Protecting your iPad from accidental drops isn't all cases are good for. Many provide extra features like the ability to automatically wake your iPad and put it into sleep mode to save battery life. Others offer integrated keyboards or built-in [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) holders to make your life easier.

 Something to mention is that we do not include cases with built-in screen protectors in our roundup below. In almost every case, you're better off going with a [separate tempered glass screen protector](https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Protector-10-2-Inch-Generation-Tempered/dp/B07QPV9MRY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) rather than getting a case with the cover built-in. This way, you can replace the screen protector without replacing your entire case.

 With all this in mind, here are the best cases for the ninth-generation iPad.

 This roundup only has case recommendations for the ninth-generation standard iPad model. They will not work with the [tenth-generation iPad](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/resolve-steamvr-problems-instantly-expert-tips-inside/). If you have another iPad model, check our [best iPad cases roundup](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-access-the-unreleased-best-in-class-5gb-console-emulators-for-windows-pcs/) to find the right cases for you!

[](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6M3ZM/A/smart-cover-for-ipad-9th-generation-english-lavender) 

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Easy to snap on/take off                             | ✗ On the expensive side                 |
| ✓ Variety of colors                                    | ✗ Not as much protection as a full case |
| ✓ Various positions for watching videos, drawing, etc. |                                         |

 The closest thing to a "standard" iPad case, Apple's [Smart Cover for iPad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6M3ZM/A/smart-cover-for-ipad-9th-generation-english-lavender) offers a blend of basic protection with lightweight materials. If your iPad is mainly for home or office use, this case will be the perfect match for it.

 The Smart Cover attaches to your iPad easily, mainly because it only covers the device's front and acts as a screen cover. Though this means less protection for the back, it's much simpler to use as a result. A magnet on the side of the cover makes it quick to attach and easy to remove.

 With the iPad cover, you can automatically wake the iPad or puts it to sleep upon opening and closing. That's not the only handy feature either---fold the cover behind the iPad to prop it up, making it convenient for writing with the Apple Pencil.

 You'll find some of the standard colors you'd expect, like black and white, but the Smart Color is also available in various fun colors. These include Electric Orange, Deep Navy, Cyprus Green, and the [English Lavender](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6M3ZM/A/smart-cover-for-ipad-9th-generation-english-lavender) color [introduced alongside the 2021 iPad mini](https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/cpp-unlocked-successfully/).

 If you want something a little fancier, you can opt for the [Leather Smart Cover](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MPUD2ZM/A/leather-smart-cover-for-ipad-7th-generation-and-ipad-air-3rd-generation-black), which adds an extra touch of class for $20 more. Still, for most people, the standard Smart Cover is all you'll ever need.

#####  Smart Cover for iPad (9th generation)

Apple's Smart Cover for iPad provides enough protection for most people while remaining thin, light, and stylish.

| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Looks very similar to the Apple Smart Cover | ✗ Slightly bulkier than the Smart Cover |
| ✓ Available in many different colors          |                                         |
| ✓ More protection than a cover                |                                         |

 Are you looking for a case similar to the [Smart Cover](https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-fall-guys-connection-errors-on-windows/), but with a bit more protection? The [JETech Case for iPad 10.2-Inch](https://www.amazon.com/JETech-Apple-10-2-Inch-Model-Generation/dp/B07QPV9Z7X?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers more protection for the back and sides of your iPad and is much more affordable than the Smart Cover.

 Whereas the Smart Cover is just that---a cover---while this is a proper case. The back of the case is a thin translucent plastic that lets you see your iPad underneath. Unlike some cases, it doesn't add significant bulk, and you won't have trouble hitting the buttons through the cutouts.

 Like the Smart Cover, the JETech case lets you orient the iPad two ways on a desk: Vertically for watching videos, and horizontally for reading, drawing, and note-taking. The cover uses magnets and features automatic sleep and wake, just like more expensive cases.

 There are tougher options available, we've even got [some featured here](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-realme-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). That said, this case provides much more protection for your iPad's back and sides than the Smart Cover.

 One final note in JETech's favor is that many colors are available.

 If you prefer that your iPad looks like a leather-bound notebook, the [Torro Genuine Leather Stand Case](https://www.amazon.com/TORRO-Genuine-Leather-Compatible-Multiple/dp/B08J47MP9P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will be right up your alley. It seriously ups the style points of your iPad while adding great protection both front and back.

 As the name implies, this folio-style case uses genuine USA-sourced, vegetable-tanned leather. It comes in a few color varieties, ranging from a natural tan to a rich deep brown. If you're looking for a splash of color, you can get the [black case with red stitching](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J48XM9Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Though it's all leather on the exterior, the Torro Stand Case has TPU inside to protect your iPad. It also has multiple stand positions, letting you use your iPad for everything from watching movies to writing and drawing with the Apple Pencil.

 The front cover supports sleep/wake functionality, and while it uses a magnet like most cases, it adds an elastic strap to ensure the cover stays closed when you're on the move. Full cutouts for the volume and power buttons mean you're not stuck hitting cumbersome built-in case buttons, as well.

 While it's not as slim as Apple's Smart Cover and not as tough as some of the more [rugged cases](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-realme-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), the Torro Leather Stand Case offers a nice balance of protection and visual flare.

 When it comes to keyboard cases, it's tough to top [Apple's Smart Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX3L2LL/A/smart-keyboard-for-ipad-9th-generation-us-english?fnode=738adb07de5c2bde86374589e879b491e4b40093107b091cbea9440cdab336d5cb1c6fbad2b0a440dfe759425696788333a4e3a47fe166872ba58dbca4acdf0e7f558ac6d012a4e6a11d9ed66a2edcaaade3cef8abe1dc0d11fcc265e23a69c5). That said, it is rather expensive, especially considering the price of the iPad itself. The [Logitech Slim Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Generation-Keyboard-Integrated-Wireless/dp/B07YFFKH27?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) rivals the Smart Keyboard with an arguably better keyboard and a much lower cost for many of the same features.

 The main feature the Logitech Slim Folio case has that Apple's Smart Keyboard doesn't is a holder for the Apple Pencil. If you frequently switch between typing and making quick notes with the [Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the built-in loop will see plenty of use.

 Another feature of the Slim Folio you won't find in Apple's equivalent is the four-year battery life. Yes, you read that right. Logitech fitted the Slim Folio with two replaceable coin cell batteries that let you use the keyboard for up to four years before replacing them. In other words, this case won't be draining your iPad's battery.

 But what about the protection factor? Logitech's folio covers your iPad's front and back, offering protection from bumps and spills. Though Logitech doesn't specify the case material, it's covered in an outer fabric that is soft but not so soft that the case will wear quickly.

 Logitech also touts the Slim Folio's "laptop-style" typing. While we doubt you'll find it as comfortable as a laptop's keyboard, some prefer it to typing on the Smart Keyboard.

 If you like the feel of Apple's keyboards, you'll want to pay the premium for the [Smart Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX3L2LL/A/smart-keyboard-for-ipad-9th-generation-us-english). Otherwise, the Slim Folio will make most people happy.

| ✓ Meets MILSPEC drop test standards  | ✗ Aesthetics won't appeal to everyone |
| ✓ Integrated Apple Pencil holder     |                                       |
| ✓ Not as bulky as other rugged cases |                                       |

 The other cases we're looking at will protect your iPad from an accidental bump off a table, but not extreme elements. If you're harder on your iPad, you'll want a tougher case, and the [UAG Metropolis](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Metropolis-Feather-Light/dp/B07YSWPHYB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will both protect your iPad and make it look like a piece of heavy equipment.

 Not only is the Metropolis rugged, but it's packed with features. The case features an Apple Pencil holder, as well as compatibility with Apple's Smart Keyboard. Its wake/sleep enabled folio-style cover even offers a detachable adjustable stand with multiple viewing angles.

 With a rugged case, it's nice to see some proof of just how tough it is. The UAG Metropolis case has that, meeting MIL-STD 810G 516.6 military drop-test standards. In UAG's testing, it endured 26 drops from four feet high with zero damage to the iPad.

 While the UAG Metropolis certainly looks tough, it isn't as thick and bulky as other rugged cases. This is useful if you're putting it inside a backpack or messenger bag and space is at a premium.

 Many rugged cases come in any color you want, as long as what you want is black. The UAG Metropolis comes in various colors, including [Cobalt](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Metropolis-Feather-Light/dp/B07YXBVKRL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Magma](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Metropolis-Feather-Light/dp/B07YXC45SR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) so that you can have some personality with your protection.

 Otterbox has been a significant player in the case world for years, while other case manufacturers come and go. The [Otterbox Symmetry Clear Series Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XQX9GN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will protect your iPad without making the tablet extremely bulky.

 While the Symmetry Clear Series is on the barebones side regarding features, it does have one that many other rugged cases lack---an integrated loop to hold an Apple Pencil. If you [use your iPad for handwritten notes](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-3-straightforward-methods-to-fine-tune-shades/) on the go, this is a crucial feature.

 The Symmetry Clear Series Case has one more interesting feature---a removable spine on one side. Take this off, and you can mount an [Apple Smart Cover](https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-fall-guys-connection-errors-on-windows/) for added protection or a [Smart Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX3L2LL/A/smart-keyboard-for-ipad-9th-generation-us-english?fnode=738adb07de5c2bde86374589e879b491e4b40093107b091cbea9440cdab336d5cb1c6fbad2b0a440dfe759425696788333a4e3a47fe166872ba58dbca4acdf0e7f558ac6d012a4e6a11d9ed66a2edcaaade3cef8abe1dc0d11fcc265e23a69c5) for easy typing.

 As the name implies, the Symmetry Clear Series Case is transparent, showing off the iPad's colorway. You won't find [military-grade materials](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/), but those cases are overkill for most people, and many tougher cases offer too many compromises when trying to use your iPad.

 Otterbox's history and name recognition mean that if you need support or make use of the lifetime warranty, you can safely assume the company will still be around in a few years. So all in all, this is a great choice for an iPad case.

 Finding the proper iPad case for kids isn't easy. The [Fintie Kids Case](https://www.amazon.com/Fintie-Friendly-Weight-Convertible-Handle/dp/B071G4YD7Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203692&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F847082%2Fbest-ipad-cases-9th-gen%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a nice blend of features and safety, as well as a rugged build that means you won't be replacing the case (or the iPad!) anytime soon.

 The Fintie Kids Case looks the part, making the iPad look more like a toy than a fancy piece of technology. It also comes in various kid-friendly colors like blue, pink, and red, plus a more classic black color. The material is thick foam rather than hard plastic, making it kid-proof.

 One of the major features of the Fintie Kids Case is its built-in handle. This makes holding the iPad easier, but that's not all it does. The handle doubles as an adjustable stand, letting the iPad stand up for watching videos or tilt back for drawing with the Apple Pencil.

 The thick foam body has cutouts for buttons and ports, so keep in mind this isn't fully liquid-proof. That said, the cutouts make plugging in the iPad to charge a more straightforward process than you would see with other kid-focused cases, so it's a worthwhile trade-off.
