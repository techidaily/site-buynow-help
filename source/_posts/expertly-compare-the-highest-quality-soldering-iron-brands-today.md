##  What to Look for in a Soldering Iron

 While all soldering irons are expected to get hot, and sometimes very hot, here are other key factors to consider when looking for the best soldering irons to buy.

 Assuming you already know [how to use a soldering iron](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/a-visionary-leap-to-4k-the-eizo-coloredge-monitor-review-for-2024/), the next thing to consider is what types of projects you intend to use it for. This can help you [decide the right wattage](https://eleshop.eu/knowledgebase/how-much-power/), temperature, and budget for your soldering projects, for instance.

 The wattage of a soldering iron gives you an idea of how quickly it heats up and cools down and is a key determinant. Usually, the higher the wattage, the faster it heats up and the longer it retains heat. The irons in this roundup range from 60 to 88 watts.

 Additionally, it's important to consider temperature control. Soldering irons with temperature control allows for temperature adjustments to suit different projects. Conversely, soldering irons without temperature control may only be used for a limited number of tasks.

 With removable tips, you can change your soldering tips when they become worn, damaged, or oxidized, unlike soldering irons with fixed tips. Tips need replacing when they become defective or when cleaning and tinning become less effective.

 So, watch out for wattage, temperature, and tip when shopping for good soldering irons. All the soldering irons discussed here come with ample wattage, temperature control, and removable tips. They’re also ergonomic, with anti-skid and heat-resistant handles.

_Pinecil_

| Pros                                                | Cons                 |

| USB-powered with auto standby function              |                      |

 The [Pinecil Smart Mini Portable Soldering Iron](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/) (version 2) by PINE64 is arguably one of the best soldering irons available. It features a stainless steel core in a polycarbonate shell and weighs only 28 grams. Rated 88 watts, it reaches operating temperature in just 6 seconds and has a temperature range of 212-752 degrees Fahrenheit.

 Temperature adjustment buttons and a 0.69-inch OLED display make for easy readouts. The Pinecil is powered by a USB-C port (with PD and QC 3.0 support) or a barrel DC jack and won’t start heating until you press the + button, even when plugged in. It also has an auto-standby function in case you forget to disconnect, and cools down pretty fast.
