## The Revolutionary Raspberry Pi Pico Takes on Dual Architectures with a Cutting-Edge RISC Design

Everybody's favorite microcontroller board is back and better than ever. Raspberry Pi Pico 2 sports a higher core clock speed, double the RAM of its predecessor, full backwards compatibility with existing Pico hardware and software, plus a dual-architecture design that lets users flip between ARM and RISC-V.

 Pi Pico 2 is built on the new RP2350 microcontroller. It contains dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 and RISC-V Hazard3 150MHz CPUs, 520KB of SRAM memory, 4MP of QSPI flash storage, and new ARM TrustZone security architecture (ARM only). Although the 26-pin GPIO remains, there are now four 12-bit ADC pins.

 These are substantial improvements—Pi Pico 2 is basically twice as powerful as the original Pico microcontroller board. Still, RISC-V is the biggest surprise. Users can jump into the two RISC-V cores at bootup and enjoy the full brunt of the Pi Pico 2's hardware capabilities, minus the ARM security stuff, of course.

 The RISC-V architecture is an _open_ alternative to ARM and x86\. Any company can dive into RISC-V without exposing themselves to the hellish patent landscape of Intel, AMD, ARM, Apple, and Qualcomm. If a CPU complies with RISC-V standards, it can run RISC-V applications. In theory, widespread adoption of RISC-V will lead to stronger competition and quicker innovation in the computer hardware industry.

 Also, RISC-V follows longstanding Reduce Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles. Applications built for RISC-V can be incredibly simple and efficient, thereby reducing the need for expensive, power-hungry CPUs. ARM is also based on RISC principals and enjoys similar architectural benefits.

 The RISC-V ecosystem is still new, though. Eben Upon, co-founder of Raspberry Pi, made this point in a [discussion with Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/what-eben-upton-said-about-risc-v) last year. "The RISC-V world is immature compared to the ARM world," there's a glaring "shortage of good, licensable high-performance \[RISC-V\] cores," and the open-source philosophy has proven to be a hurdle for standardization.

 A full pivot to RISC-V wouldn't make sense for Raspberry Pi, at least not in 2024\. However, a dual-arcitecture design in a simple machine like the Pi Pico is an interesting, compelling idea. Not only does it make RISC-V development more accessible, but it creates an environment where [Hazard3](https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3) may enjoy mainstream use and standardization. By the way, Hazard3 was developed by Raspberry Pi's Principal Engineer, Luke Wren, in his "free time." Impressive.

 You can [purchase the Pi Pico 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) for $5\. A wireless version, the Pi Pico 2 W, will arrive later this year with an Infineon 43439 modem.
