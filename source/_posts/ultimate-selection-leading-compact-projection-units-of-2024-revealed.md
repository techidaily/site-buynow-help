##  What to Look For in a Short Throw Projector in 2024

 Short throw and ultra short throw (UST) projectors use special lenses and mirrors to project a large image without needing to be placed significantly farther from the screen. Although manufacturers clearly market short throw and UST projectors, you can confirm whether a projector is a short throw by checking its throw ratio. A short throw projector has a throw ratio of less than 1.0\. Similarly, UST projectors have a throw ratio of less than 0.4.

 Beyond the throw ratio, the short throw and UST projectors are the same as regular projectors. So, when picking up a short or ultra short throw projector, you’ll have to keep [the same basic few details](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/essential-guide-starting-wordpad-efficiently-on-windows/) in mind that you will consider when picking up a regular projector.

 When it comes to resolution, [4K](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) projectors are becoming increasingly affordable. However, a 1080p model can still provide a satisfying viewing experience if you're on a tight budget. Rest assured, you won’t sacrifice too much in image quality, although a 4K projector will deliver a more detailed and crisp image.

 The projector's brightness is a key consideration, especially to your room's lighting conditions. For dark rooms, a brightness rating of 500 to 1,000 ANSI lumens is optimal. However, if your setup has ambient light, using a projector with a brightness rating higher than 1,000 ANSI lumens is better. Projectors with over 2,000 ANSI lumens are perfect for well-lit rooms.

 Remember, the size of the projected image should also be considered while deciding the required brightness. You need higher brightness for larger images. Also, if you want a good HDR experience, it’s better to have higher brightness.

 You’ll come across two types of light sources in projectors: [lamps and lasers](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-flavorful-frontier-groundbrenant-title-strategies-for-food-networks/). Lamp-based projectors are more affordable, but the lamps have a shorter lifespan than lasers. However, laser-based projectors can run longer and be more efficient.

 Finally, check for smart TV platforms, HDR and [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) support, gaming features, and portability if these are important to you. Not all short throw or UST projectors have these.

| Pros                         | Cons                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Impressive brightness        | Expensive                            |
| Built-in Android TV platform | Lacks full-color calibration support |
| Excellent picture quality    |                                      |

 The [Epson EpiqVision Ultra LS800](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fepson-ls800-4k-pro-uhd-ultra-short-throw-3-chip-3lcd-laser-projector-4000-lumens-hdr-up-to150-android-tv-yamaha-speakers-black%2F6513602.p) is an impressive UST projector that gets extremely bright, making it suitable for most ambient light conditions. It uses a laser-phosphor light source that’s rated 20,000 hours at full power, meaning that even if you use the projector for 5 hours every day, it’ll last more than 10 years.

 Although it’s not a native 4K projector, it uses [pixel-shift technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel%5Fshifting) to double the resolution from full HD to 4K, resulting in similar visuals to a native 4K projector. It has no distracting rainbow effect or color issues that plague DLP projectors and delivers excellent color performance. It also has a decent [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/) and [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/).

 HDR10 and HLG support is present, and thanks to its 4,000 ANSI lumens [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/), HDR content looks terrific. The LS800 also comes with [Android TV](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) onboard, giving you access to a vast library of apps for streaming content. Moreover, the built-in support for [Chromecast](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-dji-x20-drone-vision-wear-review/) can come in handy for casting content from your phone or Chrome on your computer.

 There are three HDMI 2.0 ports, all of which can handle 4K at 60Hz. However, the HDMI 3 port can also accept a 1080p 120Hz signal, which is helpful for gaming sources. The built-in Yamaha sound system is decent, but for a good experience, it’s best to pair it with a soundbar.

 Unfortunately, the LS800 is quite big and not easy to move around. It lacks full-color calibration support, so purists won’t be happy.

 If you're looking to save money, consider the [Epson EpiqVision Ultra LS300](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-EpiqVision-Streaming-Projector-Android/dp/B08GKZC2BN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It performs similarly to the LS800, but without the pixel shifting feature, you'll get a 1080p resolution. Additionally, the LS300 doesn't support a 120Hz refresh rate, which may be a consideration for gamers.

 The [Optoma ML1080ST](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-ML1080ST-Ultra-Portable-Projector-Lumens/dp/B0CMZKYSTC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a compact short throw projector with a full-HD resolution and an RGB laser light source. It’s not exactly a budget model, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a cheaper high-quality projector.

 Thanks to its RGB laser light source, it offers 105% coverage of the BT.2020 color space, resulting in accurate and lifelike colors. While it doesn’t get super bright, it can reach up to 685 ANSI lumens in Bright Mode and 550 lumens in Cinema Mode (according to [Projector Reviews](https://www.projectorreviews.com/optoma/optoma-ml1080-portable-rgb-laser-projector-review/)). So, it’s most suitable for dark or low ambient light environments and a picture size of less than 100 inches, which will be more than enough for most people.

 It lacks a popular smart TV operating system like Android TV. However, Optoma has a built-in media player that supports a wide range of video formats. You can also download apps from the company’s marketplace, which includes Crunchyroll, [Disney+](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-to-snapchat-creating-compact-shareable-content/), [Max](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-harness-the-power-of-windows-photos-and-story-remix-for-editing/), Netflix, Plex, and Prime Video. That said, you’ll need the company’s [EZC wireless USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-EZC-USB-Wireless-Bluetooth-Projectors/dp/B0CVR9XBKD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to get Wi-Fi connectivity.

 ML1080ST is also a great option for gaming and comes with a dedicated [Game Mode](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/) that provides low input lag. There is also an HDMI 2.1 port to connect your favorite video game console. You also get [HDR10 and HLG](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) support to enjoy HDR content.

 Another benefit of the Optoma ML1080ST is its portable size. It’s easy to carry and can be powered with a compatible battery bank.

 If you want a 4K resolution, you can consider the [Nomvdic P1000](https://www.amazon.com/NOMVDIC-Projector-Keystone-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B0C658MKX7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It’s about $300 more expensive than the Optoma offering but can be significantly brighter at 2300 ANSI lumens. It also has built-in Wi-Fi but lacks a smart TV operating system.

Elite Projector

| Pros                 | Cons                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| All-in-one package   | Basic speakers                |
| Good picture quality | No built-in smart TV platform |
| Easy to set up       |                               |

 While you can use any reasonably compact projector as a [portable projector](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-tweet-to-snap-showcase-video-posting-techniques-for-2024/), our best portable short throw projector pick—the [Elite Projector MosicGO Sport](https://www.amazon.com/Projector-MosicGO-Battery-Included-Projection/dp/B0854G1XPN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)—is an all-in-one ultra short throw solution that’ll work pretty much anywhere. It doesn’t matter if you have AC power or a projector screen—the MosicGO Sport has a built-in battery, and the company bundles a portable projector screen to use with the device. It’s also rated [IPX2](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/) to handle light rain and splashes.

 It’s a 1080p DLP projector with LED lamps as the light source and can reach 1,000 ANSI lumens of brightness. While this isn’t much, it will deliver a good-looking picture in low ambient light or dark environments.

 The built-in 37,200mAh battery can handle up to two hours of video projection. The projector’s built-in USB ports can also charge mobile devices if needed. Two HDMI 1.4 ports connect streaming devices, gaming consoles, computers, and other devices. Moreover, gamers will appreciate its relatively low input lag.

 There is also a basic 2 x 8W stereo speaker setup. However, you can connect an external speaker using the built-in 3.5mm audio jack.

 Overall, there is much to like about the Elite Projector offering. You can also set it up in minutes. Unfortunately, there is no built-in smart TV platform, so you must rely on [streaming devices](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-prime-selection-of-screen-capture-software-for-gaming/).

 If the built-in battery and the bundled screen aren’t crucial, you can consider our budget picks, the [Optoma ML1080ST](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-ML1080ST-Ultra-Portable-Projector-Lumens/dp/B0CMZKYSTC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Nomvdic P1000](https://www.amazon.com/NOMVDIC-Projector-Keystone-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B0C658MKX7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Both are excellent compact projectors that deliver a wonderful experience. While the ML1080ST is limited to full-HD resolution, the P1000 supports 4K.

| Pros                                 | Cons                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 4K resolution and 240Hz refresh rate | Built-in fan can be a bit loud |
| Low input lag                        | Some rainbow artifacts         |
| High peak brightness                 |                                |

 If [you want a short throw projector for gaming](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/vives-incredible-journey-through-unmatched-immersion-world/), it’s hard to go wrong with the [BenQ X500i](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-Projector-Response-Supports-Crosshair/dp/B0CK4B8DVW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It supports up to 4K resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. The X500i also uses a full-HD DLP chip, delivering 4K resolution using pixel shift technology. You also get an incredibly low input lag and two HDMI 2.0 ports for connecting your gaming consoles or PC. Plus, there are RPG and FPS-specific game modes to provide a fine-tuned video and audio experience.

 Picture quality is excellent, and the [X500i provides 84% coverage](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essence-of-crossfading-soundtracks/) of the DCI-P3 color space. While the color gamut isn’t as impressive as an RGB laser projector, the X500i still delivers vibrant colors. You also get HDR10 and HLG support, which allows you to enjoy supported games, movies, and TV shows in high dynamic range. The four-LED lamp on this BenQ projector can deliver up to 2,200 ANSI lumens of brightness, which is enough to handle most ambient light conditions and large picture projections.

 While the BenQ projector doesn’t come with an onboard smart TV operating system, the company supplies an Android TV dongle that can be installed inside the projector shell. The installation process is a bit of a hassle, though. Of course, you can always plug a streaming device into one of the two HDMI ports onboard.

 Unfortunately, the built-in fan can be loud, and like other DLP projectors, it shows some rainbow artifacts.

Hisense

| Pros                                | Cons                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Impressive picture quality          | Some rainbow artifacts |
| High peak brightness                |                        |
| Dolby Vision and Atmos support      |                        |
| Built-in Google TV operating system |                        |

 The [Hisense PX2 Pro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1778559-REG/hisense%5Fpx2%5Fpro%5Ftrichroma%5Flaser%5Fust%5Fprojector.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU2003611) is our pick for the best 4K short throw projector because of its fantastic feature set. It uses an RGB laser light source to deliver a wide color gamut, resulting in accurate and lifelike visuals. While it’s based on a 1080p DLP chip, like many other 4K projectors, it employs pixel-shifting tech to offer 4K resolution.

 The PX2 Pro is also rated for 2,400 ANSI lumens of brightness. As a result, it’ll be suitable for most ambient light conditions. Hisense also says you can use it to project up to a 130-inch image.

 It’s an impressive option for home cinema because it supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos and has a built-in Filmmaker Mode. It also comes with the Google TV operating system, which gives you access to all popular streaming services. Plus, you can connect your Blu-ray or DVD player using the HDMI ports. Speaking of HDMI, there are two HDMI 2.1 and one HDMI 2.0 port. You also get Wi-Fi and Ethernet for internet connectivity.

 It has a sleek design, and because it’s an ultra short throw projector, you can place it right next to the screen and still get a large picture projection. For example, you only need a 48cm distance from the screen for a 130-inch image. Also, while the Hisense offering isn’t built for gamers, it has a low enough input ratio for casual gaming.

 Sadly, some people [may notice rainbow artifacts](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hisense-px2-pro-trichroma-laser-cinema) because the projector uses a DLP chip. But otherwise, it’s a solid 4K UST projector for anyone.

It uses an RGB laser light source for a wide color gamut and an impressive peak brightness of 3,000 lumens. So, whether or not you place this projector in a light-controlled environment, you’ll get excellent visual performance.

 It can deliver up to a 150-inch image and has a 4K resolution enabled by pixel shift technology. Picture quality is amazing, and you’ll be pretty happy with the projector’s visual abilities.

 You also get 3D support, and the company graciously includes two 3D glasses in the box. So, as long as you have access to 3D content, you can enjoy it right out of the box.

 The UST projector excels in connectivity, supporting Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and Ethernet. Moreover, it has three HDMI 2.0 ports, including one that supports [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) to pass high-resolution sound to a connected soundbar.

 On the smart TV front, although the onboard software is based on a stripped-down version of Android 9.0, you can't use it to install apps. So, the AWOL Vision offering is bundled with an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max to offer access to popular streaming services. As both the projector and the Fire TV Stick 4K Max support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HDR10, you’ll have no trouble getting the most out of your favorite content.

 Gamers will be happy with the LTV-3000 Pro as it has a low input lag and supports 1080p 120Hz signal in Turbo Mode, in addition to 4K 60Hz.

 If the AWOL VISION LTV-3000 Pro is out of your budget, you can also consider the company’s [LTV-2500](https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-2500-Projector-Included/dp/B0B6HXCMQJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-short-throw-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It is very similar to the LTV-3000 Pro but has a lower peak brightness of 2600 lumens and lacks support for home automation systems such as Control4, Savant, and Crestron.

## FAQ

### What does short throw mean in terms of projectors?

 Short throw refers to the distance a projector needs to be placed from the screen to get the desired image size. A short throw projector is helpful in situations where you have a space constraint but still want to project a large image.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Is a short throw or long throw projector better?

 While short throw and long throw projectors can deliver similar performance, choosing between them [comes down to the needs of your setup](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-iphone-12-mini-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/). If you are installing a projector in a small room or want to place it closer to the screen, then a short throw projector is your friend. But if you have a larger room and aren’t concerned about the projector's placement, you can save money by opting for a long throw projector. Remember that you may need to mount your long throw projector on the ceiling for the best results, which can be a hassle.

### Do short throw projectors need a special screen?

 Short throw projectors don’t need a special screen. You can use the same screen with short throw, ultra short throw, and long throw projectors. But you’ll need to carefully [choose a screen](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2plus-by-drfone-android/) regardless of which projector you have to get the best results.

### Can a short throw projector replace a TV?

 A short throw projector can [potentially replace a TV](https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/mac-users-essential-stellar-file-wiping-tool-version-the-ultimate-guide-to-using-the-efficient-and-secure-standard-version-of-the-stellar-eraser-on-your-mac1/), but the best TVs still deliver better image quality than similarly priced projectors. You also don’t typically have to worry about ambient light as long you have a TV with decent brightness, and it’s relatively easy to install a TV and get watching. However, a projector can be an excellent alternative to a TV if you want a cinematic viewing experience.
