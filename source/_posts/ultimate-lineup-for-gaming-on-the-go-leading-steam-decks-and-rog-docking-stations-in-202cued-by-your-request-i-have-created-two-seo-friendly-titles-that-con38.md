##  What to Look for in a Steam Deck or ROG Ally Dock

 Regarding docking stations, you might be tempted to dive right in with first-party offerings, such as the [Valve Steam Deck Docking Station](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock), or the [ROG Gaming Charger Dock](https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/chargers-and-adapters/rog-gaming-charger-dock/). While these are both undoubtedly excellent options, they're not exactly the most cost-effective, and depending on what you're looking to gain from your docking station, you may find they are lacking in certain areas.

 For instance, if you're simply looking to connect your handheld to a big-screen TV or gaming monitor, you may not need an abundance of USB ports on your dock. However, if you want to repurpose your Steam Deck or ROG Ally into a gaming PC, you will want a docking station that can accommodate peripherals, such as a mouse and keyboard, for extra versatility.

 Selecting a dock that can support 100W power delivery will benefit a more full-fat setup, as you'll be able to provide power to all your add-on devices without diminishing your overall gaming experience. You might want to consider a docking station with more premium features, such as an M.2 SSD slot, which will give you acres of convenient storage space to play with.

 Features such as Ethernet ports will provide a more stable connection for online play, while a hub with DisplayPort capabilities will allow you to set up multiple displays simultaneously. Whatever kind of docking station you're looking for, we've got the lowdown right here to help you choose the best option for your handheld PC.

JSAUX

| Pros                          | Cons                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ M.2 SSD slot                | ✗ Expensive                           |
| ✓ 100W power delivery         | ✗ Thermal performance could be better |
| ✓ Gigabit Ethernet connection |                                       |

 If you're a Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally owner looking for the best console dock overall, there's plenty to enjoy with the [JSAUX M.2 Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Ports-HB0604-Included/dp/B0BNTQWKN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It has six ports, including HDMI 2.0 (supporting 4K output at 60Hz), Gigabit Ethernet, one USB-C port, plus two USB-A ports for peripheral devices. And if that's not enough to wet your whistle, it also has an M.2 slot for SSD storage.

 Incorporating built-in NVMe SSD support into the design of this docking station is, frankly, a stroke of genius. Simply docking it gives you up to 4TBs of expandable storage for your console. It also eliminates the need to constantly cycle through your library of downloaded games, swapping them out and deleting them to make room for your current faves.

 The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station also supports 100W power delivery, so there's enough juice to power your Steam Deck at full charging speed. It also offers data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, so you can enjoy a fast and reliable gaming experience with this powerful hub, especially when using a Gigabit Ethernet connection.

 With a price tag just shy of $90, the JSAUX M.2 Docking Station won't be for everyone. However, it has everything you need for a great time with your Steam Deck, and the bonus of SSD storage support makes it more akin to using a conventional desktop PC.

Best Steam Deck Dock Overall

#####  JSAUX M.2 Docking Station

The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station is ideal for leveling up your Steam Deck gameplay, with its integrated M.2 SSD slot, super-fast data transfer speeds, and plenty of ports for connecting your gaming peripherals.

Valve

| Pros                          | Cons                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Firmare updates vis SteamOS | ✗ Expensive                             |
| ✓ FreeSync VRR support        | ✗ Not compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally |
| ✓ Includes power adapter      |                                         |

 As you might expect, Valve's official [Steam Deck Docking Station](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock) is tailor-made for Steam Deck owners. It offers a seamless experience for the Steam Deck, supporting a dual-display setup (up to 4K at 60Hz or 1440p at 120Hz), firmware updates, and even its own power adapter.

 It comes equipped with at least three USB-A 3.1 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0, though sadly, no USB-C port is included here. It provides multi-monitor support, FreeSync VRR support for external monitors, and firmware updates via SteamOS.

 This first-party docking station is the perfect match for your Steam Deck, boasting an impressive build quality and a feature-rich design. Made from the same materials as the Steam Deck, it acts as a natural extension of your handheld in terms of its look and functionality.

 On the downside, which is no great surprise, the Steam Deck Docking Station isn't compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally. Being the official docking station for Valve's handheld, you'll need to look elsewhere if you're a ROG Ally owner. Plus, you might be better off looking at more cost-effective alternatives if you're shopping on a budget.

| ✓ Integrated SD/TF slot                     |                                  |

 There are plenty of third-party docking stations that can accommodate both the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, but the [UGREEN Steam Deck Dock](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Docking-Foldable-Ethernet-Compatible/dp/B0CR6JND4M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one that, despite its name, stands out as one of the best options for ROG Ally owners.

 This 9-in-1 docking station offers exceptional versatility, with 4K support at 60Hz, 10Gbps data transfer speeds, and 100W fast charging. Crucially, it also supports the ROG Ally's Turbo Mode, so you can enjoy maximum power and the best possible frame rates for your game time.

 It comes with an integrated SD/TF slot, a boon for expandable storage space, while the adjustable display stand allows you to set the viewing angle you prefer. Plus, the viewing stand has been designed so as not to obstruct the ROG Ally's cooling vents, letting you play for longer without your console overheating.

 Though it may be marketed as a Steam Deck docking station, the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock is one of the best docking stations available for the ASUS ROG Ally. This high-performance hub offers plenty of versatility to enable you to play the way you want to, and it doesn't look too shabby, either.

| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Can charge two devices at the same time      | ✗ Expensive for what it is                     |
| ✓ Supports display output of up to 4K at 60 Hz | ✗ Not as versatile as some third-party options |
| ✓ Compact, space-saving design                 |                                                |

 The official docking station for the ASUS ROG Ally, the [ROG Gaming Charger Dock](https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/chargers-and-adapters/rog-gaming-charger-dock/) is an all-in-one charger for your handheld. This 65W charger dock allows simultaneous PD3.0 fast charging while providing display output at up to 4K at 60Hz via its HDMI 2.0 port.

 It features a USB-C port and USB-A port and can charge two devices simultaneously, using 60W and 5W of charging power for the USB-C and USB-A ports, respectively.

 Compact and convenient, the ROG Gaming Charger Dock has a high portability factor and can easily be stowed away inside a bag or backpack. It allows you to plug in your ROG Ally wherever you go. Its discreet, space-saving design won't cause any undue cable clutter on your desk or near your TV.

 On the downside, this charger dock is rather expensive for what it is, and it does lack a Gigabit Ethernet port. Its comparative lack of features may prove off-putting to some, particularly those who want as much versatility as possible from their charging dock. However, for those who are eager to invest in the official option, this is a sleek customer that performs well.

Sabrent

| Pros                                                | Cons                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable                                        | ✗ Not as feature-rich as some more premium options |
| ✓ Plenty of space for additional devices            |                                                    |
| ✓ Compatible with both Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally |                                                    |

 At first glance, the [Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Docking-Station-Devices-DS-SD6P/dp/B0BTJYY8MD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) looks rather unassuming. Similar in design to the [Valve Steam Deck Docking Station](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock), it has a sleek and minimalist look that lacks a bit of visual flair. Nevertheless, it's compatible with the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, offers six ports (including three USB-A and two USB-C), supports 4K resolution (with a 60Hz refresh rate), and costs less than $30.

 With three USB-A ports, this dock is ideal for hooking up additional devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, to turn your handheld into a mini gaming desktop. The Type-C ports (something that the official Valve option lacks) can be used for power delivery or external storage, while the HDMI port allows you to use a secondary display, such as a TV or monitor.

 It's versatile enough to be compatible with other USB-C devices and provides a sturdy non-slip base on which it can be placed. It also supports PD 3.0 with up to 95W charging speeds, meaning that your device can be charged quickly while docked.

 The Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station will appeal to anyone who loves the look of the Valve Steam Deck Docking Station but doesn't want to pay the premium asking price for the official model. And while it lacks the bells and whistles of the Valve Dock, it still represents excellent value for money, with enough features to satisfy many Steam Deck (or ROG Ally) fans.

 The [Syntech Mini Dock](https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) scores high in the portability stakes. Compatible with both the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, this pint-sized port is one of the smallest currently available and comes with a fairly modest price tag to boot. It packs neatly into any bag or backpack and makes docking your ROG ally or Steam Deck a cinch when you're on the move.

 The Syntech Mini Dock has been designed with a rounded base, providing good stability when docking your handheld. Thanks to its sturdier foundation, you don't need to worry about your console tipping over, despite this dock's smaller size. It has six ports, including an HDMI 2.0 port (which supports up to 4K at 60Hz), three USB-A ports for external devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and USB-C. 

 The docking station features anti-slip grips inside the console cradle so that your device holds its position, and a gripped pad on the bottom of the dock keeps it firmly rooted to your table or desk. As another handy quality-of-life feature, it can accommodate most protective cases, so you won't need to remove these before docking your device.

 The Syntech Mini Dock is ideal for anyone who likes to travel on their Steam Deck or ROG Ally and is looking for a stable and effective space-saving dock that won't break the bank.

[$39 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

## FAQ

### How do I connect my Steam Deck or ROG Ally to a TV?

 To connect your Steam Deck or ROG Ally to your TV, you'll need to connect a USB-C hub or USB-C to HDMI cable to your TV (with the HDMI end), with the USB-C end plugged into your console. 

 With your TV on, select the corresponding HDMI input option and make sure your Steam Deck or ROG Ally is switched on. Your handheld's display will then be visible on your TV screen. 

### Can I use a Steam Deck dock with my ROG Ally?

 With the exception of the official Valve Steam Deck Docking Station, most third-party docking stations are compatible with both the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, as well as other devices with USB-C ports. 

### Is the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally better?

 When it comes to [which handheld is best](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-10-leading-no-cost-webcalls-for-businesses/) between the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it largely comes down to personal preference.

 The ROG Ally is undoubtedly the most powerful of the two handhelds and runs up to 50% faster than the Steam Deck. It also has the advantage of running Windows 11 (compared to Steam Deck's SteamOS, which runs on Linux) which gives you access to other storefronts. 

 In contrast, the Steam Deck offers a marginally better battery life, and arguably provides the best tactile experience, with its precision trackpad and more familiar button array. It's also considerably cheaper than the ROG Ally, which makes it the more accessible of the two. 

### Can I play non-Steam games on the Steam Deck?

 Yes, you can. The Steam Deck also features a desktop mode, and when you switch across to desktop mode, you can install games and software here, which are not readily available from the Steam store.

### Can I play Steam games on the ROG Ally?

 Yes. The ASUS ROG Ally runs on Windows 11, which means you can install Steam on there and play anything you have saved in your Steam library.
