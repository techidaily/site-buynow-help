##  What to Look For In a Tablet Stand in 2023

 Tablet stands come in different shapes and form factors. And with so many options, it can be hard to choose. Thankfully, we’ve made things easier for you by highlighting some of the key things to look for in a tablet stand.

 Just like tablets, tablet stands also come in different sizes. So, make sure to buy tablet stands that are compatible with the size of your tablet. The featured tablet stands support phones/tablets between 4 and 13 inches.

 Tablet stands also serve different purposes. Therefore, consider what you want to use the tablet stand for. The best tablet stand for you will always be one that does what you need it to do. For instance, a bed tablet stand is best for someone using their tablet to browse while mostly lying down.

 Design is another important factor to consider. For instance, if you plan to use your tablet in bed, you’ll want to look for designs that suit this purpose. This means you should consider designs with a strong clamp and an adjustable and extendable arm.

 Can your preferred tablet stand support your other devices, such as your phone, game controllers, or even laptops? The best tablet stands also support other compatible-sized devices you may have.

 Extras like cable management are also nice to have as it helps you to keep your cables neatly organized while using the tablet stand. Rubber stoppers are also useful as they prevent your tablet from sliding off while in use.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Highly flexible yet sturdy gooseneck tablet holder | Shaky and wobbly when tapped              |
| Supports 4.7 to 10.5-inch phones and tablets       | Bolt clamp base can buckle under pressure |
| 30 inches long, suitable for multiple uses         |                                           |

Interestingly, as flexible as it is (so much so that it coils up), it is still a solid, sturdy, and dependable stand.

 It supports 4.7 to 10.5 inch phones and tablets, but this stand is only suitable for viewing purposes. Due to its design, it will shake and wobble quite noticeably if you have to tap or touch the device. The tablet won't fall out of the stand, but it would make any kind of work very difficult to accomplish.

 Its arm is 30 inches long and made of Aluminium-Magnesium alloy, a stiffened material. This allows you to twist it into different shapes (S and O-shapes are the most stable). It also has a reinforced bolt clamp base suitable for up to 3-inch countertops and headboards.

 The Tryone Gooseneck Tablet Holder can help you hold your tablets for video conferencing, livestreaming, presentations, gaming, cooking, and even as a secondary screen. It is available in [black](https://www.amazon.com/Tryone-Gooseneck-Nintendo-Samsung-Overall/dp/B01AUQ33LG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001334&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablet-stands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [white](https://www.amazon.com/Tryone-Gooseneck-Nintendo-Samsung-Overall/dp/B01AUQ33K2/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001334&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tablet-stands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).
